            <p>This Metroidvania is minimal in every way, but manages to
            deliver a great gameplay experience by focussing on the
            essentials.</p>

            <p>Big Brother meets … Big Brother. In this pixellated tale of
                dystopian reality game show, you’re tasked with completing
                a series of platforming puzzles — by fair means or foul.</p>

            <p>Spiritfarer is a captivating game with exploration, crafting,
                and platforming elements, woven around the moving stories of
                its characters.</p>

    <p>See <a href="/2019/08/01/nintendo-switch-reviews">all Nintendo Switch
        reviews</a> for the complete set. I am also writing a series of
        <a href="/2019/10/07/one-hour-reviews">One Hour reviews</a> which are
        more concise, and cover games I’ve played briefly, for free. And there’s
        more: I’ve recently started a series of
        <a href="/2020/02/18/switch-notes">‘Switch Notes’</a>, which summarise a
        game in ten points I consider most important.</p>

    <p>I also write <a href="http://switchplayer.net/author/bobbyjack/">reviews
        for Switch Player magazine</a>.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>

    <p>I have a huge amount of <a href="/2019/10/18/software">software</a> I’ve
        cobbled together over the years, gathering dust on my hard-drive. Some
        of this is worthy of releasing, and I’ll be doing exactly that, slowly.
        First up is <a href="/2019/09/18/about-stealthtacks">Stealthtacks</a>, a
        simple <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> client.</p>

    <p>As of October 2019, I’m working on a little experiment called
        <a href="/2019/10/03/bunner-contents">Bunner</a>, a simple turn-based 2d
        puzzle game.</p>

    <p>I’ll release more in due course, probably first via
        <a href="https://github.com/bobbykjack/">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2>All Nintendo Switch games</h2>

    <p>I’m maintaining a <a href="/2020/06/12/all-nintendo-switch-games">league
        table of all the Switch games I’ve played</a>, whether I’ve reviewed
        them or not. It will be updated regularly, and the latest version will
        always be available here. Spoiler alert: <cite>Breath of the Wild</cite>
        is the greatest Nintendo Switch game, and will probably remain so.</p>
