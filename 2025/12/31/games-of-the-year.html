            <h1>My Games of the Year, 2025</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                <b>2025 was a unique year in gaming, for me.</b>
                For a start, it was the first time I’ve bought two consecutive
                Nintendo home consoles; previously, I’ve owned a SNES, Game Boy,
                Wii, and Switch. I consider the Switch 2 a resounding success,
                but this first year has brought very few ‘must-have’ releases.
                I’m not big on 3D <cite>Metroid</cite>, and I refuse to count
                all those “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition”s of seven-year-old games
                as real full releases.
            </p>

            <p>
                Financial reasons, too, meant that, aside from a couple of
                pricey AAAs, I haven’t been purchasing too much in the way of
                new games. Still, that leaves a considerable backlog and plenty
                of top-quality indie games on the pile, so my 2025 wasn’t
                entirely game-free! Here are my personal highlights.
            </p>

            <h2>Mario Kart World</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/mario-kart-world/mario-bros-circuit.jpg"
                    width="1280"

                />
                <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                The one game everyone had to pick up alongside a Switch 2,
                right? I’m not the biggest <cite>Kart</cite> fan, but the
                promise of an open-world element had me intrigued, and there’s
                really no better two-player game you can pick up on a new
                system. Everyone knows <cite>Mario Kart</cite> by now, and
                everyone can pick up a controller and have some fun.
            </p>

            <p>
                <cite>World</cite> delivered big time, giving us an entry to get
                engrossed in while waiting for the next big thing. It wasn’t
                quite the revolution promised, but it sure delivered on all the
                core points. Only purists focussed on the minor differences
                between this iteration and any of the previous eight. The rest
                of us had a blast with much-improved graphics, some fun tweaks
                to the gameplay, and an unforgettable Rainbow Road experience.
                Although it won’t go down as one of my favourite games of all
                time, <cite>MKW</cite>’s general appeal and huge success at
                showcasing the Switch 2 makes it my <b>Game of the year</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>Donkey Kong Bananza</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/donkey-kong-bananza/fire-rain.jpg"

            <p>
                Face it: after a slightly prosaic launch, most of us were
                gritting our teeth, praying for a successful 3D platformer that
                felt like a launch title. <cite>Bananza</cite> was all of that
                and much more. The main mechanic may be a bit rough around the
                edges—it could certainly benefit from some camera improvements,
                for a start—and not quite as ground-breaking (god, ...) as some
                suggested, but it certainly gave us a fun game. After a few
                minutes of mayhem, it was easy to forget about the lack of a
                real <cite>Odyssey 2</cite>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sadly, my playthrough got a bit derailed, so I’m still waiting
                to finish this one off. I started out trying to collect every
                last banana, but that completionist desire waned from about the
                mid-game. I’m hoping this is one I can get back into, though,
                because, at its peak, it was an incredibly engrossing,
                captivating adventure that proves 3D platformers still have
                plenty of imagination left in them. So much so, that it scores
                as my <b>Most fun game of the year</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h2>

            <figure style="margin-bottom: 1em">

                Talking of Donk, I can’t ignore the big guy’s big release that
                kicked off my year. I hadn’t played the original, and had never
                played a DKC game through until the end before, but
                <cite>DKCR</cite> really grabbed me. I finally got it: this
                style of fast, flowing, punishing platforming is a perfect
                accompaniament to the more laid-back approach that Mario takes.
                Although it was new for me, this one figures as my
                <b>Re-release of the year</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>Silksong</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/silksong/boss.jpg"

            <p>
                Somewhat of a painful subject for me, this one. Without doubt,
                this was my most anticipated game that has ever released. I
                waited through those painful years of silence, I got hyped up by
                the seemingly imminent release in 2021. Four years later, the
                game’s eventual arrival could never quite live up to
                expectations.
            </p>

            <p>
                <cite>Siksong</cite> is an amazing game, but it exists for me in
                a weird middle ground. Far more closely aligned to the original
                than I expected, it was just a bit of an anti-climax. That’s not
                to say it’s not an amazing, spectacularly good game, it’s just
                more of a 9 than a 10 in my book. A lot of that may come down to
                the difficulty level; I’ve concluded that I’m <em>just</em> good
                enough to enjoy <cite>Hollow Knight</cite> but not
                <em>quite</em> good enough to enjoy <cite>Silksong</cite> at the
                same stratospheric level. In other words, <cite>Silksong</cite>,
                it’s not you, it’s me. <b>Indie game of the year</b>.

            <h2>Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</h2>

            <figure style="margin-bottom: 1em">

            <p>
                Following on from
                <a href="/2024/12/31/games-of-the-year.html">last year’s</a>
                <cite>Super Mario World</cite>, a retro Mario playthrough is
                becoming something of a tradition. The difference this time
                around was that I’d never played <cite>Land 2</cite> before. I’m
                not sure why; I <em>adored</em> <cite>Land</cite>, which was
                pretty much my first ever Mario game. I think
                <cite>Land 2</cite> arrived just a little too late for me to
                notice at the time.
            </p>

            <p>
                And that’s a shame, because <cite>6 Golden Coins</cite> is a
                very good game and, for the Game Boy, a huge achievement. I
                don’t think the scale adjustment is <em>perfect</em> (maybe a
                compromise between the two would be ideal?) but the overall look
                and feel of the game is right up there with
                <cite>Super Mario World</cite> and some of the level designs are
                up there with the very best Mario has to offer. It’s a shame
                that the last level is so absurdly frustrating!
                <cite>Land 2</cite> wins this year’s
                <b>Best Retro Mario</b> award.

                I can’t argue with any of those three adjectives; this game is
                truly stunning and I’m glad I managed to reconnect with it after
                a couple of false starts. Are some of the puzzles annoying? Yes.
                Should some of them make it more obvious what you need to do?
                Undoubtedly. Have I too-often resorted to trial-and-error?
                Absolutely. But this is still one of the greatest puzzle games
                I’ve ever had the fortune to play, a heady mash-up of pure
                puzzle pleasure and exhilarating exporation. This game was my
                <b>Best rescued from the backlog</b> title in 2025.

                I played a lot of puzzlers in 2025, and most of the best were
                published—and often developed—by
                <a href="https://www.draknek.org/">Draknek &amp; Friends</a>.
                Many of these—<cite>A Monster’s Expedition</cite>,
                <cite>Bonfire Peaks</cite>—were old favourites, so I’m
                excavating the back catalogue now, which took me all the way
                back to <cite>Sokobond</cite>, my pick for
                <b>Best old puzzler</b> in 2025.
            </p>

            <p>
                The game’s visuals are as simple as could be, but they help the
                clever mechanics and twisted puzzle design shine through. I’m
                still struggling to make it through every last one of the
                levels—some of the post-game content is
                <em>really tough</em> but this is a great
                pick-up-and-get-frustrated game that I can dive back into at any
                time.

            <p>
                And, at the other end of the timeline, comes Draknek’s latest
                puzzler (well, until Spooky Express, which is more of a mash-up
                anyway—a monster mash-up!). This was a really short game, but
                one with a hefty amount of additional challenge at the end.

            <p>
                The grapple hook (who doesn’t love one?) opened up a lot of
                really interesting possibilities, and I’m just hoping it will be
                developed into a fuller sequel at some point, because there’s a
                much more involved experience lurking here somewhere. Still,
