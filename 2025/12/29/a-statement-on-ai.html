            <h1>A statement on AI</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                <b>When I was around 12 years old, I went on the holiday of a lifetime: a trip to New York City.</b> As an unsophisticated Brit, who grew up in a village, it was incredibly exciting: full of lights, late-night meals, and buildings taller than seemed possible.
            </p>

			<p>During that trip, our generous host offered to buy me a book of my choice, and I opted for a collection of essays on artificial intelligence. That’s the kind of kid I was. This fascination with AI was very much a product of the time, when robots were ever-present in our ‘culture’ (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/"><cite>Short Circuit</cite></a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/"><cite>The Terminator</cite></a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"><cite>The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</cite></a>) and the most rudimentary forms of chatbot (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA"><cite>ELIZA</cite></a>) were basically another form of video game.</p>

			<p>After that, my interest waned. I avoided the optional AI-related project at university. I shared the common disappointment with ‘AI-lite’ tools like Microsoft’s much-loathed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Clippy</a>. Ideas that had once seemed intriguing had become annoying, maybe as a result of their adoption by global megacorps.</p>

			<p>Keep fast-fowarding until the cusp of 2026. AI is everywhere, but never has it felt more depressing. Any positive uses are overshadowed by the bad: slop-generators replacing jobs and hallucinations sidelining the expression of actual human thoughts and feelings.</p>

			<p>I refuse to be a part of this. Fortunately, it’s still possible to be a conscientious objector—at least, in some contexts, such as my own personal writing.</p>

			<p><mark style="background-color: #ffc;">So, on this site, I will never use AI to write an article, I will never prompt an LLM to vomit out a bunch of nonsense and redirect that nonsense onto a page here.</mark></p>

			<p>(I never <em>have</em>, BTW, I just want to emphasise that I never <em>will</em>, either!)</p>
