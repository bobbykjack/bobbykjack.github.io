        "the adventures of elena temple",
        "than my eye \u2014 still looking out through retro-tinted glasses \u2014 was caught by",
        ".",
        "what struck me initially was the stunning use of two-colour graphics, not just in the main sprite and primary platforming objects, but also the backgrounds, enemies, and bosses too \u2014 everything here is rendered in just two colours, with big chunky pixels, and it all looks beautiful.",
        "the first level sets the scene well by guiding you very carefully to a \u2018secret\u2019 room",
        "too often, games that use very restricted colour palettes and/or resolutions suffer from a common problem: conveying function. heck, it\u2019s a problem that can plague any platformer, but in particular those with less detail. most obviously, this manifests in whether a specific element is \u2018active\u2019, in the foreground, and can be interacted with or whether it\u2019s just background detail which can safely be ignored.",
        "manages to create a clear distinction and makes it look effortless. almost everything that can be interacted with moves. almost every platforming object is either obvious in context, or reliably \u2018solid\u2019 enough to identify. the different palettes, despite offering the smallest amount of difference imaginable, each somehow feel different \u2014 i suppose this is quite considerably due to associations between the colours and the gaming systems they represent.",
        "apart from the usual, the mechanic that sets this game aside is the \u2018soar\u2019, a very low-gravity fall which allows for plenty of movement. it\u2019s a bit like the float mechanic provided by mario\u2019s cape or raccoon tail, without any of the additional flying mechanics, but permanently available. a skilled combination of normal fall and float is required to tackle some of the enemies present: although the standard \u2018jump on head\u2019 move has been faithfully borrowed, it\u2019s made slightly trickier by the small size of some of the creatures that can do you harm.",
        "probably my favourite colour scheme, this shot shows off a number of items including disappearing platforms, locked doors ... and a snail",
        "also armed with a rudimentary catapult, pixboy\u2019s challenge is, predictably, to reach the end point of each scrolling level, avoiding or killing enemies as he goes. there are four worlds with 10 levels in each, the last level of each world featuring a boss. early levels can be completed in 15\u201330 seconds, but later ones clock-in at a few minutes each.",
        "everything feels right. the standard jump \u2014 although it\u2019s paired with a very slow fall, even when not floating \u2014 is variable and smooth. none of the enemies or obstacles feel unfairly difficult, and all the secret areas or locked rooms can be solved easily, with enough effort required to add variety to the overall experience. plenty of classic elements are present \u2014 you know the ones: disappearing platforms, spikes on rotating tiles. there are a few more unusual mechanisms such as the conveyer belts (?) which you fall through unless jumping, in which case they\u2019ll propel you upwards. but everything is accessible enough to make",
        "feel like a game within everyone\u2019s grasp.",
        "every level has four challenges which add a lot of extra play, especially towards the end of the game",
        "the result is something very much like a top-notch game boy platformer: think",

        "vibe, although",
        "is much more interesting in terms of overall level design \u2014 this isn\u2019t just about running left-to-right all the time! it also reminded me of certain old spectrum games \u2014 the two-tone palette no doubt reinforces this \u2014 and this kind of resolution certainly suits handheld gameplay very nicely indeed. but it\u2019s so much more polished than the spectrum or game boy games i remember. partly that\u2019s down to level design, but there are also two key aspects here which really go a long way in making",
        "the game that it is.",
        "first, the game adopts a modern approach to lives, in which each level is self-contained. there\u2019s no need to complete everything in one run, so the player is free to experiment and take risks at their own pace. there\u2019s even an abundance of free lives to pick up in each level, so even the toughest can be quite forgiving. although i started quite slowly, by the time i got into the late-game, it was pretty quick to complete: you might only get 2 or 3 hours out of that core challenge.",
        "but here\u2019s the other difference: again, in a more modern take on the genre, each level is not just for getting through. there are effectively four additional challenges for each of the 40 levels here: collect all coins, collect all hidden ice lollies, speedrun, and \u2018pacifist\u2019 \u2014 don\u2019t kill anything! the only small flaw i found here is that the \u2018ice lolly\u2019 challenge, which requires discovering secret rooms, is made somewhat redundant by the coin challenge since those rooms always contain coins too.",

        "verdict",
        "\ud83d\ude03",
        "of all the games that claim to cater for lovers of retro gaming, pixboy is possibly the one that has felt the most satisfying to me recently. both in terms of how well it replicates an original experience, but also how good it feels to play as a game today. it doesn\u2019t really offer anything new, but the attention to detail and overall design make this a very fun game indeed. there might only be 40 levels here, but they are great to play, and pixboy offers a huge amount of replayability.",

        "the map is sparse but surprisingly useful \u2014 it\u2019s easy to get lost in that matrix of rooms",
        "plays like a metroidvania-lite, with a gloriously nostalgic \u2018single-screen rooms in a 2d grid\u2019 layout. most of these rooms play like self-contained puzzles or feature tough platforming challenges and the map is full of collectibles, secret pathways, and optional challenges.",
        "although the jump feels awkward by today\u2019s standards \u2014 it\u2019s fixed-height, very low-gravity, and very slow \u2014 it feels like a pretty accurate recreation of an 8-bit game and the overall style strongly reminded me of the game boy. obviously, the game boy-themed palette helps reinforce that. the game features many classic platforming elements including retracting spikes, collapsing platforms, and buttons to push or (hint) shoot at.",

        "many of the rooms you build provide a \u2018mini-game\u2019 to add a small amount of challenge to the standard crafting mechanic, and also to provide a very welcome element of additional entertainment. for example, the sawmill tasks you with moving a blade up and down, in order to follow a wavy \u2018cutting line\u2019 alongside the length of each log that passed through. whilst the skill involved is minimal, it\u2019s a brilliant innovation that means there\u2019s rarely a dull moment at sea.",

        "is a bewitching combination of arcade pinball mechanics and enchanting metroidvania. but is it more than the sum of its parts, or does the gimmick result in a game which falls short of the two genres\u2019 potential?",
        "the environment is scattered with flippers, allowing you to access every remote spot",
        "arriving on mokumana beach as yoku, a lovable dung-beetle, your movement is constrained by the enormous pinball tied to your belly: you can push it left and right, but that\u2019s about it. soon, however, you\u2019ll come across the first pinball flipper built into the ground, waiting to propel you forward, and things start opening up. although some are initially locked, these flippers perform the same function that jumping does, and they vary in placement and angle, offering a far greater range of movement than mere legwork can accomplish.",
        "the game soon introduces a host of metroidvania components, including blocked pathways, plenty of helpful npcs, and currency (fruit) to collect, in order to purchase items. pretty soon, you\u2019re exploring the map, finding items to assist your quest, and making progress in much the same way as any other game in the genre.",
        "despite the familiar approach,",
        "feels open and expansive. partly, this is due to a finely balanced map which really isn\u2019t locked down",
        "that much",
        ". also, the very nature of the environment lends itself to free movement: much of the time you\u2019re outdoors, with plenty of surrounding space, and flippers move you long distances fairly quickly.",
        "even the more complex tables are small and basic, but still great fun to play",
        "ultimately, those flippers come into their own when they\u2019re attached to one of the many \u2018mini-pinball tables\u2019 dotted around the landscape. most are required to navigate to make progress, and most are blocking you one way or another, until a certain exit is opened or a given condition fulfilled.",
        "each table typically features a combination of traditional pinball features \u2014 bumpers, lanes, drop targets, pegs, rollovers, stoppers \u2014 and a few original features such as collectibles to open doors, and slugs to \u2026 er \u2026 break barriers if you suck them up with a vacuum (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s explained along the way!).",
        "the tables are abundant in their supply of fruit, and there\u2019s no \u2018losing the ball\u2019 as such \u2014 if you miss it with the main flippers, it tends to fall into a patch of thorns which remove one solitary piece of fruit. fruit is",
        "everywhere",
        ", so this is no hardship, and the more you play each table, the more fruit you\u2019ll gather anyway.",
        "there\u2019s no doubt the tables are a fun distraction, and certainly add an original edge to this metroidvania. as a pinball fan, i appreciate that the mechanics are done well enough to make me feel like i",
        "am",
        "actually playing a mini game of pinball \u2014 there\u2019s no complaint there. where the tables",
        "do",
        "fall down, unfortunately, is their simplicity. they are not difficult in the slightest, and tend to be on the small side, with only a handful of features. it feels as though the developers went all-in on the metroidvania, did some excellent work polishing the pinball mechanics to make everything smooth, but then failed to replicate this effort in designing the tables themselves. the tables are a diversion, never really a destination, which is a shame.",
        "a good example is multiball. on a traditional pinball table, multiball is a hectic rollercoaster ride, during which the player can score huge points bonuses. it\u2019s pure fun, and i was",
        "really",
        "excited when i realised yie was presenting me with its own version. however, multiball here just serves to highlight how sparse the tables really are: there\u2019s no huge point-scoring, because the game isn\u2019t really about that. and the adrenalin rush just doesn\u2019t kick in when there\u2019s no jeopardy; in fact, multiball becomes a bit of a slog because the aim is for each ball to find a different \u2018resting place\u2019, something like those old puzzles with tiny ball-bearings. and those are slow, slow games, they\u2019re not pinball.",
        "the gorgeous visuals look good zoomed in or out",
        "it should be obvious from the screenshots, but",
        "is beautiful. the bright, vivid graphics are sure to appeal to younger players, but the whole look is one that anyone should be able to appreciate. some of the details, particularly in scenes involving npcs, are incredibly fine, and it\u2019s obvious that a lot of work has gone into refining the look.",
        "as with any metroidvania, there are various themed \u2018zones\u2019 ranging from standard \u2018grassy outdoors\u2019 to underground caverns and icy tundra. they merge into each other seamlessly, and contribute to an overall map that is sprawling, but manageable. although some backtracking is involved, it\u2019s not too far from one end to the other, and a \u2018fast-travel\u2019 system is waiting to be unlocked too.",
        "it\u2019s a big advantage to be able to see the whole map at any time, and to be able to seamlessly travel across the whole expanse without any significant loading screens interrupting. the \u2018map\u2019 view is essentially just a zoomed-out version of the main view you play in. whilst this looks very nice, it\u2019s a bit of a problem in practice since a map usually",
        "benefits",
        "from removing and simplifying detail.",
        "cuteness, cuteness everywhere \u2014 yoku will melt all but the most cynical of hearts!",
        "the game is brimming with amusing little touches, such as the party whistle you\u2019ll acquire early on. it serves a purpose, but it\u2019s also incredibly charming \u2014 i defy anyone to resist instinctively blowing that whistle as they traverse yoku\u2019s world.",
        "so, fun gameplay, adorable characters, attractive graphics, and an inventive mix of mechanics should result in a knock-it-out-of-the-park hit, right? unfortunately,",
        "has one significant downside, although just how much it matters will depend on what kind of player you are.",
        "is easy. very easy. there is basically no way to die. it\u2019s possible that \u2018losing the ball\u2019 in a pinball table, when you have zero fruit, will end your run \u2014 i never found out. i doubt few but the youngest players will ever find out, it\u2019s just not that likely to happen.",
        "in the main world, there\u2019s nothing that can harm you at all \u2014 even the most dangerous-seeming creatures are benign, and you\u2019ll survive the highest of falls. sometimes those falls get annoying because of where you end up on the map, but it\u2019s just time you\u2019ll lose, never progress.",
        "it\u2019s difficult to judge how much a difficulty level can affect a game because every player has their own level of skill. but, really,",
        "is so easy, it sometimes felt like i was going through the motions, simply following along with what the game wanted me to do, having less impact than i might have expected. and the ease of the pinball tables combines with the ease of the main adventure in a less-than-satisfying way.",

        "so,",

        "the pinball is fun, but it\u2019s more diverting than engrossing. the main adventure is a bit more captivating, and it\u2019s a wonderful experience, but it\u2019s fairly short, and very straightforward. there\u2019s plenty for completionists to sink their teeth into, though, and this is a perfect game to return to when you\u2019re after a bit of light entertainment.",
        "is a highly accessible game, and it\u2019s an enjoyable one if you can accept the lack of depth. anyone who enjoys both the pinball and metroidvania genres is sure to have a good time here. don\u2019t expect a pure, fully-featured pinball experience, though, and if you\u2019re the type of player who",

        "you might see new objects, revealed from the new perspective, including doors to previously hidden areas. or an individual platform might be narrow when observed from one side, then grow much wider, and more accessible, when rotated.  so a jump that was far too long in one view becomes trivial when rotated: the landscape is constantly malleable.",

        "each mind perceives a different beauty",
        "is a gorgeous game to look at. the incredible attention to detail led me, from time-to-time, to just sit back and drink it all in. the pixel-art on show is simply stunning, probably the best realisation of a much-used style that i\u2019ve seen in a game. it\u2019s not just attractive in its own right, it perfectly reflects the setting too.",

        "overall, the controls are complex, to say the least. few platformers make quite so much use of the keyboard: not only are there standard controls to move, in addition to those that rotate the camera, there are also two or three different \u2018action\u2019 keys",
        "and",
        "four different keys to pan in all directions. i rarely used the panning action, but it\u2019s still there, cognitively loading me up.",
        "the world map is another good example of what is wrong with this game. it\u2019s an amazing feat of engineering, and the end effect will blow your mind once you realise how to use the damn thing, but that\u2019s the problem: it\u2019s not easy to use. it\u2019s probably the clearest example of the \u2018style over substance\u2019 problem that",
        "can suffer from.",
        "the map is impressive, and a work of art in its own right, but incredibly frustrating to actually use",

        "this metroidvania is minimal in every way, but manages to\ndeliver a great gameplay experience by focussing on the essentials.",
        "the \u2018overworld\u2019 screen allows travel between the four settings, although the order in which you\u2019ll do everything is relatively fixed.",
        "i have a confession. i\u2019ve never played a metroid game. i know, i know: hand in my gaming card, how can i even pretend to have any credibility when it comes to reviewing video games, right? and it gets worse: even though i\u2019ve played one or two entries in the castlevania series, i haven\u2019t even played symphony of the night, the one that lent its suffix to the metroidvania genre that i\u2019ve become so fond of.",
        "it\u2019s a cross i\u2019ll just have to bear for now \u2014 at least until i can be bothered to play them on nso. for now, though, i\u2019m thinking",
        "is a pretty decent substitute, at least for the original metroid.",
        "this snail is one of a handful of regular, trickier enemies.",
        "xeodrifter is ultra-minimal yet, if my understanding of metroid is even slightly accurate (gained as it was from a quick few minutes scanning a gameplay video), still manages to improve on the old 8-bit games it pays homage to in some key respects.",
        "first off, while its graphics are still all chunky pixels and limited colour palettes, it\u2019s at least brighter and more refined than its nes counterpart. backgrounds are more detailed \u2014 something which actually becomes relevant later in the game \u2014 and plenty of smooth animation helps to refine the experience.",
        "but, far more importantly, there\u2019s a level of usability that, understandably, simply wasn\u2019t present 35 years ago. it\u2019s all the little things that add up to make an experience enjoyable: proper saving \u2014 checkpoints, even! \u2014 fewer moments of sheer frustration, a better explanation of what the heck\u2019s going on.\ni don\u2019t want to spend this entire review bagging on metroid, though, so i\u2019ll stop with the comparisons about now. what really matters is how xeodrifter plays today, not how it compares with some game that\u2019s older than half the world\u2019s population. and, as far as i\u2019m concerned, xeodrifter plays really well.",
        "another slightly trickier enemy, but it can\u2019t really cope with you ducking \u2026",
        "it\u2019s an excellent size for a game, more a mini-metroidvania than a vast, sprawling behemoth like hollow knight. this is one you could polish off in a weekend \u2014 heck, even a long single sitting, if that\u2019s how you roll. i chose to break it into 2 or 3 sessions, but it had me gripped enough to pull me back each time, at the expense of anything more substantial vying for my attention.",
        "the setting is not much to get excited about. despite four unique environments, which do have some interesting properties to differentiate them, everything looks a bit too generic to really stand out. but that\u2019s no great loss since it focuses everything on your main task: exploring the map, collecting the upgrades, opening up previously inaccessible routes, and fighting a series of bosses until completion. actually, the same boss, which somehow learns new moves each time you face it. god knows why it doesn\u2019t just unleash its final attack on you during the first encounter, preferring to give you the opportunity to learn how to deal with it gradually, over a series of meet-ups. well, it\u2019s obvious of course: gameplay wins over plot or logical immersion.",
        "the boss is much more of a challenge. curiously, i found its first appearance trickier than any of the other times we met to do battle.",
        "and xeodrifter just about nails its gameplay, a few minor complaints aside. first, it balances everything \u2018just so\u2019. given that it\u2019s a short game, it introduces a generous number of upgrades, making good use of the classic \u2018open up previously unavailable areas mechanic\u2019 to great effect. one power-up in particular is very nicely implemented: the \u2018layer switcher\u2019. this allows you to move between foreground and background, transitioning between the two layers to explore paths that are only passable via one route or the other. it makes excellent use of the constrained map and it\u2019s a really nice visual effect to boot.",
        "some of the other main upgrades are less inspiring, but they all serve a useful purpose, whether it\u2019s navigating water with the submarine, or sprinting across the hazardous pink goo. alongside these abilities come upgrades to your gun, and \u2014 again \u2014 the system here is simple but the game makes the most of it. upgrades are scattered about, and each one can be applied in a number of different ways to affect how bullets fire: speed, power, direction, etc. these can be switched up at any time, and it\u2019s an excellent way of adding variety to a single weapon.",
        "this screen packs in an awful lot of info, but it explains very little of it!",
        "the boss fights in xeodrifter are, as already mentioned, somewhat repetitive, but they have a rewarding level of difficulty, and the upgrades you gain can \u2014 and must \u2014 be used against each iteration, as it develops its powers. this can be easy to miss \u2014 in fact, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s easy to miss here since explanation is scant. from the gun upgrades to boss behaviour, and even how some of the powers work, you\u2019ll need to figure everything out with very little help on offer. but it\u2019s all so manageable, pitched at such a reasonable level of difficulty, that nothing\u2019s really going to slow down your progress for long.",
        "there are one or two small annoyances. the jumping can be really disconcerting at times, with possibly too much momentum propelling you into enemy paths when you land. secret areas are often of the \u2018totally hidden\u2019 type, where you simply need to try pushing against walls that turn out to be secret passageways. this makes for some manual hunting around rather than calling on any clever detective skills. and the early game can be a bit frustrating since health is tricky to regain. but, overall, the positives vastly outweigh these gripes and xeodrifter is up there with",
        "gato roboto",
        "as the best example of what retro mini-metroidvanias have to offer.",

        "\ud83d\ude00",
        "is such a good example of a very small but excellently formed metroidvania, that i think it should be on some game development course somewhere. a perfect game to play through in a weekend, especially for those who like the genre\u2019s classic ingredients, but aren\u2019t keen on getting lost exploring vast maps.",

        "they continue in much the same vein way for quite some time, but more variation slowly gets added. the main problem is typically how to move each \u2018box\u2019 without putting it in a position from which it cannot be moved. sometimes this involves moving it in an uninuitive direction. other times it involves moving multiple boxes as part of the same \u2018step\u2019. some of the levels can be tackled in reverse: work out how it\u2019s possible to move a box onto each target square, then work backwards from there.",
        "many of the puzzles are symmetrical, with half the bozes on one side, half on the other. this makes for pleasing visuals, but in terms of gameplay, it just produces two smaller, identical puzzles. it\u2019s not much fun doing the same puzzle twice, although it seems there is sometimes a concession to this \u2014 e.g. one half is upside-down, at least.",
        "it\u2019s slightly annoying that the boxes that are key to the game aren\u2019t \u2026 really boxes? am i the only one seeing that weird protrusion at the top that kinda makes them look like some kind of sleeping bag or fridge freezer. they sure aren\u2019t the thing in this picture:",

        "so the first 20-30 levels or so are all pretty straightforward, some are downright disappointing, particularly when the solution is trivially easy, even still at this stage. but, then, there are some really well designed, fun-to-play, challenging levels. level 28, for example, was the first that really grabbed me as an excellent puzzle level. level 29, in contrast, was pedestrian \u2014 just no challenge at all. then came level 35, which was absolutely delightful, a real gem of a level.",
        "i really did feel grateful for these wonderfully well put-together levels, but overall quality was inconsistent. there must\u2019ve been about 10-15 very good levels, 30-40 almost pointless ones, and about half middling.",

        "laylee\u2019s other great purpose is to add a couple of actions to your moveset, namely a mario-esque twirl and a, er, mario-esque ground-pound. as a result, losing laylee restricts your movement a bit, so the levels all have to be designed for this possibility. therefore, twirl and ground-pound are never really required, they just make things a lot easier, and open up access to a few secrets respectively. this kind of optional variety is something that",
        "returns to time and time again, and it\u2019s one of the major plus points of the game.",
        "both powers also help you obtain feathers, the game\u2019s main in-level currency. they\u2019re not always lying about, either: many are spawned by special feathers you interact with in a few different ways. again, the variety adds a bit more interest beyond just the standard collectathon. feathers are used to buy upgrades, another gimmick i\u2019ll cover shortly.",
        "gimmick success rating: 4/5",
        "gimmick #3: coin challenges and paywalls",
        "like many games in this genre, each level in",
        "contains a small number of collectibles lying off the beaten path. here, these are big coins, hardly an original concept. the innovation comes in how they\u2019re used, which is integral to how you\u2019ll choose to play the game.",
        "paywalls start off cheap, but fail to collect too many t.w.i.t. coins, and you\u2019ll start having to backtrack pretty early on.",
        "levels are revealed in groups of three, in different areas of the map. but each area is, by default, inaccessible until you pay to lower a literal paywall\u2014jokes! the number required gets progressively larger, but it\u2019s always pitched at a decent level, a compromise between having to grind every last coin and being able to just rush through ignoring them.",
        "this approach does offer flexibility, however. you can take on each level methodically, trying to get all five coins as you go, and progress in a strictly linear fashion. or you can speed through, picking up coins wherever you happen upon them, only to backtrack later and replay earlier levels. the style you adopt is totally up to you; i guess most players will go for some kind of compromise, as i did myself.",
        "collecting all five coins gives you a burst of confetti at the stage end, but it\u2019s the overall progress this allows that\u2019s the real reward.",
        "some may balk at the concept of backtracking, particularly when it\u2019s enforced in order to make progress on the main path of the game. but fear not:",
        "has some great ideas on how to mitigate the monotony of repitition.",
        "gimmick #4: an array of upgrades",
        "another type of collectible, tonics are available in the hub world (and more on this in a minute). these are upgrades you can switch in and out to modify your build, something we\u2019re used to from other genres (metroidvania, roguelikes) but less so in straight left-to-right platformers. tonics have to be discovered",
        "and then bought",
        "using the feather currency.",
        "there\u2019s a large number of tonics, broken down into two types: functional and decorative. the functional type include things like an auto-feather-gatherer, longer invincibility when hit, and a triple-twirl. there\u2019s even a series of penalty tonics which do things like reverse the controls or make enemies harder to kill. both types make sense because they affect a feather multiplier which alters the total number of feathers you pick up during a level.",
        "visual effects from decorative tonics include various display ratios, colour changes, and even a heavy pixel filter.",
        "holy pixels. many of the more interesting visual-effect tonics make levels pretty difficult to navigate, so you can only really use them if you\u2019re pretty familiar with the layout already.",
        "the idea, presumably, is to make backtracking and replaying levels a bit less repetitive. it works, to an extent. the tonics are quite expensive, and you only get three slots for the most part. the feather-gatherer is just a permanent fixture for me, so there\u2019s not a lot of wiggle room. and the visual effects, while a nice novelty, often change the look a bit",
        "too",
        "much, becoming something of a distraction. some of these affect the characters themselves, amd are more appealing\u2014i wish there were more of them.",
        "in general, the tonics are a great little bonus, but few of them are useful enough to repay the effort required to obtain them.",

        "goes in hard on its hub world and, for me, the effort pays off gloriously. it\u2019s a top-down, 3d, fixed-camera map, much like the hub-world in",
        "super mario 3d world",
        "but, er, 3d. as in: height really is a factor, you can reach different vertical levels, that third dimension is actually a thing.",
        "the map uncovers with your starting point at the centre, and pathways appear that link back to previous areas, keeping everything nicely within reach.",
        "but, far more importantly, it contains puzzles and side-quests galore, and all those tonics i mentioned earlier. this map also unifies the levels, of course. it means it\u2019s pretty big, but you can zip from level-to-level without having to walk manually\u2014something i unfortunately didn\u2019t discover until i\u2019d played a good few hours and wasted a lot of time trudging around! never mind, i didn\u2019t once get sick of exploring this hub world, as it\u2019s full of secrets and free feathers and all sorts of stuff.",
        "every now and again, you\u2019ll encounter a cave or a tunnel leading to a mini-puzzle that reveals a bonus tonic or unlocks a level\u2019s counterpart. yes, each of the 20 levels has a second version, and these are implemented with a great big bundle of creativity. some levels transform into flooded versions of their standard layout. others add ice, flip the world upside-down, or change into a vertical climb to the finish.",
        "besides this, the variety of levels is already huge, with chase sequences and non-linear challenges thrown into the mix. honestly,",
        "gives the impression that the developers just thought \u201clet\u2019s just chuck everything we can think of in here\u201d but, importantly, they spent time making sure it all worked really well together.",
        "the hub world is stuffed full of puzzles. they\u2019re all pretty basic tasks that won\u2019t tax your grey matter too much, but they help mix up the action.",
        "if you\u2019re looking for just 2d platform level after 2d level, you might find the hub world an unwanted diversion, but i welcomed it wholeheartedly. i sometimes found myself having spent a whole half hour after starting the game, still wandering around the hub world without playing a single 2d level. it\u2019s that enticing.",
        "gimmick success rating: 5/5",
        "un-bee-lievable",
        "so, once you\u2019ve conquered as many of the game\u2019s 20 levels as you can, and gathered as many of the 48 bees as possible, it\u2019s time to return to that lair. this is the point at which the game becomes something utterly different from everything that\u2019s gone before. the experience is about one part mesmerising to two parts soul-destroying.",
        "see, the impossible lair really is much,",
        "much",
        "harder than the rest of the game, even though the later standard levels get a bit trickier. the lair is",
        "long",
        "; even the fastest speedrunners take over 10 minutes to conquer its 5 parts, and typical players will take, realisitcally, about twice as long to see it through from start to end.",
        "but that will only be after many, many failed attempts. i took 60. i\u2019ve seen others take quite a few more. now, granted, i spent a lot of time trying to play the checkpoint system; mercifully, there still is one, although this mammoth level only has four of them in total, and they don\u2019t restore lost bees. these checkpoints are essentially indefinite, recording your best attempt so you can pick it up from a later stage at any point.",
        "my final stats. the remaining five bees are all secrets which i became too impatient to hunt down. the final figure tells you i took 60 attempts to conquer the \u2018impossible\u2019 lair. wait\u2026 why\u2019s it labelled \u2018not so imposible\u2019? oh, \u2026",
        "all this means the final level will test you in ways unlike anything else in the game. it\u2019s a shame the previous levels don\u2019t really prepare you for it, and the challenge ramps up like a rollercoaster. i",
