<h2>bobbyjack.me</h2>

<p>Since April 2019, I have written <a href="/2019/08/01/nintendo-switch-reviews">reviews of 19 Nintendo Switch games</a> for this site, alongside a series of shorter <a href="/2019/10/07/one-hour-reviews">One Hour reviews</a> which are more concise and cover games Iâ€™ve played briefly, for free.</p>

<h2>Switch Player &amp; Ninty Fresh magazines</h2>

<p>In February 2020, I began writing reviews and contributing features for <a href="http://switchplayer.net/">Switch Player Magazine</a>, an online and print publication. As of July 2022, <a href="http://switchplayer.net/author/bobbyjack/">I have written 42 reviews</a>.</p>

<p>The highlight was undoubtedly my review for <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/09/16/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review/">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> which was afforded a <a href="/pdf/super-mario-3d-all-stars.pdf">five-page spread in the October 2020 issue</a>. I also wrote a feature retrospective of <a style="font-style: italic" href="/pdf/baba-is-you-retrospective.pdf">Baba Is You</a> for the July 2020 magazine.</p>

<p>My role has since developed with promotions to Reviews Editor and, in 2021, Editor-in-Chief. As Editor, I take overall responsibility for the magazine, develop new features, proof &amp; edit each issue, and manage the team. I continue to write content and manage the review process in this role.</p>

<h2>Make Use Of</h2>

<p>In October 2020, I started a position as <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/author/bobby-jack/">Staff Writer at MakeUseOf</a>. The role demands pitching ideas for articles relating to technology in the wider sense; I currently specialise in topics covering programming, gaming, and the explanation of technical concepts.</p>

<p>In July 2021 I took on a role as a Floating Editor which involves proofing and editing articles on a daily basis. In March 2022, I started working as an Editor for the Programming section of the site.</p>

<h2>Medium</h2>

<p>I first wrote for <a href="https://bobbyjack.medium.com/">Medium</a> in September 2020, on a range of issues covering gaming, technology, and film. I am a contributor to publications including <a href="https://medium.com/swlh">The Startup</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english">JavaScript in Plain English</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/super-jump">SUPERJUMP</a>, and <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/">Level Up Coding</a>.
