<h1>All Nintendo Switch games</h1>

<p>This is a list of all Nintendo Switch games that I’ve played, in approximate order of preference, as of June 2020. This is just <em>my opinion</em>, which is <em>highly subjective</em> and is based purely on <em>how I’m feeling today</em>. I revise the list regularly; titles may go up as well as down.</p>

<p>Games that I’ve reviewed are linked to that review. All others are awaiting review. They are strong candidates for moving in the list when that review happens.</p>

<p><b>Games in bold</b> are new to the list since <a href="/2020/02/21/all-nintendo-switch-games">the last time</a>. There are a <b>lot</b> of new entries this time round. You might notice that most of the new titles are in the lower half of the table. These are mostly games I’ve reviewed for <a href="http://switchplayer.net/"><cite>Switch Player magazine</cite></a> and, since these are chosen for me to review rather than games I've actively picked to buy, they tend to appear lower down.</p>

Full of issues, with a lack of any objective, it’s barely a ‘game’ as far as I’m concerned. But I am still totally absorbed, enough to play for an hour a day on average, since launch!</li>

        <b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/04/18/duck-souls-review/">Duck Souls+</a></b>
        — this is my highest-rated game reviewed for <cite>Switch Player</cite> so
        far, and is an absolute gem: very much like a cut-down (and slightly easier)
        version of <a href="/2019/07/28/celeste"><cite>Celeste</cite></a>. With a duck.

    <li><b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/05/15/wonder-boy-returns-remix-review/">Wonder Boy Returns Remix</a></b> — I loved this classic platformer with shoot-em-up elements but it’s showing its age and certainly isn’t for everyone.</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/04/12/voxelgram-review/">Voxelgram</a></b> — a puzzler that has awkward controls but nonetheless replicates the <cite>Picross</cite> experience very nicely.</li>
    <li><b><a href="/2020/06/05/elena-temple">The Adventures of Elena Temple</a></b> — this retro platformer has a nice ‘backstory’ and great core gameplay, but it’s very much for old-school fans only.</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/06/11/damaged-in-transit-review/">Damaged In Transit</a></b> — some games are great but suffer from a steep difficulty curve, and this multitasking puzzler is certainly one of them!</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/04/04/pupaipo-space-deluxe-review/">PuPaiPo Space Deluxe</a></b> — short and sweet with plenty of great bosses, almost a bullet-hell but maybe slightly less hellish than that implies.</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/02/28/build-a-bridge-review/">Build a Bridge!</a></b> — one of several bridge-building games on the Switch, nothing really stands out about this one although the core gameplay is reasonably fun.</li>
    <li><a href="/2019/05/03/dig-dog">Dig Dog</a></li>
    <li><b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/05/19/cannibal-cuisine-review/">Cannibal Cuisine</a></b> — I found the unsavoury nature of this one was a bit of a turn-off and there were plenty of bugs to cope with, although the co-op action is undoubtedly entertaining.</li>
    <li>Super One More Jump</li>

    <li><a href="/2019/06/21/kid-tripp">Kid Tripp</a></li>
    <li><b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/04/05/king-lucas-review/">King Lucas</a></b> — a great idea, this roguelite platformer takes place in a map that gets larger each time round, but it’s poorly executed.</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/05/16/brotherhood-united-review/">Brotherhood United</a></b> — A run ’n’ gunner which isn’t bad at all, but isn’t really something I’d choose to play.</li>
    <li><a href="/2019/10/26/super-box-land-demake">Super Box Land Demake</a></li>
    <li>GoNNER</li>
    <li>Arcade Archives: Donkey Kong</li>

    <li><b><a href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/03/15/milos-quest-review/">Milo’s Quest</a></b> — far too easy and fails to capitalise on the combination of puzzles and combat/rpg convincingly.</li>
