            <h1>My Games of the Year, 2024</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                <b>2024—my gaming year, at least—had a strange feel to it.</b>
                With the Switch on end-of-life watch, major releases have been
                few and far between, but what <em>has</em> arrived in 2024 has
                been compelling. The following games were those that were most
                important to me this year.
            </p>

            <h2>Balatro</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/balatro/balatro-win-2.png"
                    width="1280"
                    alt=""
                />

            <p>
                Like many, many others, I was hooked by <i>Balatro</i> from the
                beginning and it hasn’t threatened to let me go since. Never has
                a game been as replayable as this, quick runs letting you
                experience a huge variety of upgrades, resulting in wildly
                different games, every time. My <b>Game of the Year</b> and
                <b>Most Played Game</b> both go to <i>Balatro</i>.
            </p>

            <h2>Animal Well</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/animal-well/mario-well.jpg"
                    width="1280"
                    alt=""
                />
                <figcaption>It’s-a-me, AniMario.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Delivering pixelated adventure perfection, <i>Animal Well</i> is
                my pick for <b>Best Indie</b>. All those freaky animals,
                rendered so beautifully, created a hypontic world that played
                with Metroidvania conventions and taunted players with
                impossible challenges. I’ll also give it
                <b>Most Frustrating Experience</b> for the latter, although
                <i>Nine Sols</i> came a close second.
            </p>

            <h2>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/prince-of-persia-lost-crown/azhdaha.jpg"
                    width="1280"
                    alt=""
                />
                <figcaption>Big boss is bad boss.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                A more traditional Metroidvania,
                <i>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</i> was a delight
                nonetheless. I found the combat took quite a bit of learning,
                but the satisfaction was well worth it. Definitely my
                <b>Best Third-Party</b> of 2024.
            </p>

            <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/learn-trampoline.jpg"
                    width="1280"
                    alt=""
                />
                <figcaption>
                    And I learned it in post-game, like an idiot.

            </figure>

            <p>
                So, Nintendo didn’t release that much this year, but the latest
                <i>Zelda</i> game helped offset that as it delivered not only
                playable Zelda, finally, but also a good old top-down,
                old-school, dungeons-and-all experience. The echo menu was
                ridiculous, but that was the only real flaw in a retro
                love-letter that still pushed boundaries.
                <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i> was the <b>Best First-Party</b> game in
                2024 by a long shot.
            </p>

            <h2>Patrick’s Parabox</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/patricks-parabox/three-way.png"
                    width="1280"
                    alt=""
                />
                <figcaption>
                    I hate that feeling that I’m being watched... by myself.

            <p>
                A bit out there, but these are the games <em>I played</em> in
                2024. I finally picked this up on sale and loved its thoughtful
                madness; it’s basically recursive sokoban.
                <i>Patrick’s Parabox</i> was the <b>Best Puzzler</b> for me.
            </p>

            <h2>Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/grapple-dogs-2/banana-hook.png"
                    width="1280"
                    alt=""
                />
                <figcaption>Swing low, sweet Chihuahua.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                This unassuming indie sequel was my
                <b>Best Platformer</b> because it delivered classic platforming
                action, following up on the original by adding a character with
                unique mechanics and their own stages to flex them in. So much
                variety and a huge amount of collectables and post-game content,
                <i>Grapple Dogs</i> had the lot.
            </p>

            <h2>Super Mario World</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/super-mario-world/smw.jpg"
                    width="1280"
                    alt=""
                />
                <figcaption>
                    The older I get, the more I look like Mario. This is less a
                    caption, more of a cry for help.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                I pretty much have to get sucked back in by a different Mario
                game each year, and this time round it was the turn of
                <i>Super Mario World</i>, which I played through at least twice.
                It still holds up so well, the cape and Yoshi were magnificent
                additions, and Mario has probably never controlled better than
                this, although I’m a big fan of <i>Super Mario Wonder</i> too.
                So <i>SMW</i> takes my <b>Best Retro Mario</b> award.
