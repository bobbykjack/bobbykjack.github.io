            <h1>Super Spy Raccoon</h1>

            <p class="intro"><b></b></p>

            Super Spy Raccoon is yet another arcade retro platformer from
            Flynn’s Arcade, publishers of <i>Cash Cow DX</i>,
            <i>Goliath Depot</i>, and the wonderful
            <i
                ><a
                    href="https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/donut-dodo-single-screen-magic/"
                    >Donut Dodo</a
                ></i
            >. All these titles seek to recreate the magic of sticky upright
            cabinets minus the cash-guzzling aspect; when did you last see an
            actual ‘coin’, anyway? <i>Super Spy Raccoon</i> looks more like a
            Commodore 64 game to me, but that’s no bad thing. I grew up with
            that computer, so the nostalgic memories are strong here.

                    This first level has a couple of potential routes to
                    success—and plenty of bushes to hide behind.

            </figure>

            <p>
                The game’s name pretty much tells you it’s going to be about
                stealth, although I don’t remember that genre being particularly
                well represented in the 80s era. It turns out the original
                <i>Castle Wolfenstein</i> (1981) was the most well-known
                example, before that series veered more towards blasting than
                hiding. Stealth games are often frowned upon for their
                frustrating, trial-and-error nature, and the mechanic is often
                shoehorned into other genres as an aside: witness recent
                examples like <i>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</i> and
                <i>Metroid Dread</i>, both of which sneak a bit of stealth into
                the main action before returning to whatever alternative the
                player no doubt prefers.
            </p>

            <p>
                But <i>Super Spy Raccoon</i> is unashamedly all about the
                stealth. Although the concept might have struggled in original
                arcades, where games were fast and targeted reflexes rather than
                brain cells, it fits modern gaming quite well. Unless you’re
                looking to maximise your score by minimising the amount your
                timer decreases, there’s no harm in taking things slowly,
                scoping out the level, and taking it one step at a time. Plan
                out how to collect each of the documents scattered across the
                level, then execute—one by one if you must. A massive contrast
                with <i>Donut Dodo</i> et al.
            </p>

            <h2>Spy vs. Spy</h2>

            <figure>
                <img
                    src="/images/games/super-spy-raccoon/spotlight.jpg"
                    width="1280"
                    alt=""
                />
                <figcaption>
                    Keep one eye on the spotlight and another on the monkeys!
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Each screen—of <i>course</i> they’re single screens!—features a
                small array of enemy ‘things’ to avoid. They start off all
                anthropomorphic: monkeys patrolling, owls on sentry duty. As you
                advance, you’ll encounter more mechanical nuisances, from
                spotlights to moving lasers, but most of these hazards work
                pretty much the same way: if they spot you, they kill you. In
                your favour are environmental helpers like bushes you can hide
                behind and platforms you can, er, stand on. It turns out that an
                owl can see you from the other side of the screen, but it’s
                totally blind to your nearby presence, if it can only see your
                feet.
            </p>

            <p>
                So the challenge is all about nailing the timing and appropriate
                pathway in order to avoid prying eyes. Some finesse is possible
                via desperate moves like jumping over the heads of those
                stationary owls or collecting the potion which makes you
                temporarily invisible. Lasers can be avoided by simply standing
                still, but monkeys aren’t as stupid. Combined, these raccoon
                detectors are effective unless you have great awareness of
                everything that’s going on, or you’ve planned out a safe passage
                in advance.
            </p>

            <p>
                With just five looping stages in total,
                <i>Super Spy Raccoon</i> is firmly in <i>Donkey Kong</i>-style
                territory, and lacks the kind of extras that made other Flynn’s
                Arcade games so compelling. Nevertheless, this is a fun
                diversion, with nicely polished mechanics, and enough of a retro
                vibe to make a solid addition to your Switch arcade
                collection—it’s cheaper than all those overpriced
                <i>Arcade Archives</i> titles too!
