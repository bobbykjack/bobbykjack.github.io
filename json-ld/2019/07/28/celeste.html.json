        "of course, a game must \u2014 first and foremost \u2014 be fun to play. any emotional journey we may undertake whilst playing it can only really be considered a bonus. thankfully,",
        "delivers in gameplay terms, too.",
        "gameplay",
        "is a \u2018masocore\u2019 (a somewhat tautological portmanteau of \u201cmasochist\u201d and \u201chardcore\u201d) game \u2014 essentially, it\u2019s designed to be very difficult and consists of individual levels that are played one-by-one, repeatedly, sometimes many times over. \u201cyou will die lots of times but you have infinite lives\u201d is essentially the vibe here. restarting each level \u2014 which typically consists of 1-3 screens \u2014 is instantaneous, though, and you can quit-and-continue at any time.",
        "right at the beginning, and a helpful bird appears to teach you some of the basics",
        "madeline, the protagonist, has a pretty common set of abilities available to navigate each level: jumping, dashing, wall-clinging. much of the main action takes place in midair, and certain strategically-placed items contribute to this; diamonds grant an extra dash, and bubbles propel maddy in any chosen direction.",
        "there\u2019s also, of course, an assortment of different platforms, some of which decay, whilst others move when the player dashes, then return to their original position. one particularly memorable section involves the transport of another character: your task involves picking them up, and carrying them across a series of levels, throwing them about when necessary.",
        "first impressions are very strong because, whilst the pixelated retro style has been done many times before, it is done very well indeed here \u2014 bright and colourful, interspersed with an illustrated, cartoon style for the all-important cut scenes. the controls feel responsive, early levels are straightforward, and the gameplay is compelling from the get-go.",
        "the graphics are simple, with chunky pixels and a restrained colour palette, but very effective and pleasing on the eye",
        "narrative",
        "back to the plot, then.",
        "celeste\u2019s",
        "narrative is so effective because it is deployed exactly at those moments that the player is most receptive to it. it is an entirely different structure to a game like",
        "hollow knight",
        "whose plot, despite being deep and colourful, failed to",
        "really",
        "grip me. the biggest challenge any story-driven game faces is to tell the story at the right pace, to prevent the eager player from simply skipping dialogue in their rush to progress.",
        "introduces its plot points just when the player has reached the peak of each act in the greater play, which is usually the gap between each of the 8 chapters that contain the game\u2019s several hundred levels.",
        "it helps that things are linear. early on, i wasn\u2019t quite sure if that was going to be the case, and certain paths suggested there might be an amount of exploration thrown into the mix. however, it turns out that optional paths are really for bonus collectibles that, to be fair, add a huge amount of content to the main game. i was never really certain of this since there is no map, but",
        "isn\u2019t the kind of game to hold your hand.",
        "although this might all sound like a straightforward setup, it still requires perfectly tuned difficulty to ensure each break in the gameplay is welcome, even required. it really does feel like pausing for breath, slowing the adrenaline right down and catching up with the story in the meantime.",
        "a mysterious \u2018part of\u2019 maddy creates some of the biggest challenges, especially in the early-game.",
        "the other distinction here is that this story is very emotional rather than event-driven. of course, things happen, but the development of madeleine\u2019s character \u2014 and that of some of the bit-players \u2014 is at the forefront. it\u2019s much easier to follow, especially since the plot mirrors the player\u2019s own experience with the game.",
        "everyone will sympathise or empathise with each character\u2019s plight to different extents. something about mr. oshiro\u2019s story moved me in a way i certainly wasn\u2019t expecting, and the mental health issues touched on here, and in the main character\u2019s tale, are dealt with a sensitivity rarely seen in video games. although this is something that is \u2014 welcomingly \u2014 becoming more common.",
        "now, some people have told me that the plot isn\u2019t",
        "that",
        "involved, and i take their point, but in a genre that\u2019s often characterised by \u2018goodie (usually male) tries to stop baddie (usually male) and, often, rescues victim of kidnapping (usually female)\u2019, the bar is already pretty low. i don\u2019t mind",
        "much whether",
        "pushes it through the roof or gently nudges it up a few feet, it",
        "does",
        "raise it, undeniably.",
        "difficulty",
        "previously, i\u2019ve struggled playing this type of game (",

        "slime-san",
        "). in particular, i reached a point in",
        "that i just could not get past. it\u2019s frustrating because i really like that game, but cannot make any progress no matter how much i try.",
        "somehow manages to avoid this problem, despite having its tricky moments \u2014 to say the least. it rides the difficulty wave just perfectly enough to prevent deadlock. maybe this is simply because it\u2019s",
        "slightly less difficult",
        "(i genuinely cannot tell!), but i have a hunch it\u2019s actually because the levels are perfectly sized.",
        "that 1-3 screen estimate i gave earlier turns out to be very significant.",
        "will rarely ask too much of the player, at least, not more than they can reasonably learn with enough persistence. i think there is certainly a sweet-spot of \u2018number of near-impossible moves\u2019 that most players can reasonably learn to pull off, and whilst",
        "just tips over that limit,",
        "manages to approach it, and stop just short. along with the plot development, it\u2019s a key driver in keeping the player motivated.",
        "a large array of elements provides great variety, including these strong winds which drastically alter movement.",
        "there are few moving enemies in the game \u2014 spikes and falls are the main hazards \u2014 and this adds to the sense of isolation, but also the idea that the challenge here is a personal one. it means that many levels can be approached calmly and reflectively, without having to rush on at a breakneck speed. there",
        "are",
        "such moments \u2014 there were times i wasn\u2019t even quite sure how i\u2019d managed to complete a certain section, it had all happened so fast \u2014 but, thankfully, there were in the minority.",
        "my single biggest issue is that something about the controls meant that i never fully mastered them. i often found myself jumping when i wanted to dash and vice versa. i also found myself holding down the \u2018grip\u2019 action to ensure i\u2019d cling onto any wall i happened to meet, even if i couldn\u2019t see it yet. overall, this could feel fiddly, especially when playing with joycons in handheld mode. ultimately, i find myself praying for a better revision of the pro-controller\u2019s d-pad.",
        "i know what i want to do; either my brain or that damn d-pad won\u2019t let me do it!",
        "it must be said that all of this applies to the main game but, not, necessarily, the reportedly nightmarish b-sides and c-sides. i have yet to take these on, although the experience of finishing the main game is certainly driving me to want to. and the upcoming dlc will only be accessible once i\u2019ve completed a few more challenges, so the incentive is certainly present!",
        "the verdict",
        "\ud83d\ude03",
        "is a challenging, gripping platform adventure, with a touching storyline and unforgettable characters. it really does deserve its reputation, and it\u2019s a game very well suited to the switch\u2019s dual nature.",
        "i\u2019ve played",
        "for",
        "15",
        "hours; i was quite surprised it wasn\u2019t longer. when you get on a run, you can really storm through a lot of levels in one sitting, though, so i guess that must\u2019ve happened alongside the odd holdup. one level, in particular \u2014 one involving feathers \u2014 had me struggling for at least half an hour, if not longer. but it didn\u2019t break me.",
        "most of my game time was docked, with the last couple of levels in handheld mode.",
