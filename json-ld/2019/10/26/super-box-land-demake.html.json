        "i went through a range of emotions playing this game, which is not an effect i\u2019d expect a box-pushing puzzler to have. unfortunately, they can be summed up with the words \u2018meh\u2019, \u2018ooh, promising\u2019, and \u2018meh\u2019 again.",

        "super box land",
        "sticks true to the",
        "formula of pushing boxes onto targets, with no complicated extras.",
        "just as every other puzzle game does, super box land starts off simple in the extreme, with a level that introduces the core mechanic, a level that it\u2019s impossible to go wrong in. unlike many other puzzlers, though, this is pretty much it. between this and level 100, all you\u2019ll really see change is the visual theme and the difficulty.",
        "of course, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. people clearly like this type of puzzle and, i suspect, would play the simplest possible version of it: just plain squares on a grid would suffice, if those individual puzzles were captivating enough. and, to give it credit,",
        "makes a token attempt to go ever-so-slightly further with a 2-player mode, and a \u2018rewind\u2019 function (more of that later). but, really, it sets itself up to be completely focussed around box-pushing, so there\u2019s very little room to hide here: we either have a set of good box-pushing puzzles, or we don\u2019t.",
        "with so little going on in terms of gameplay mechanics, you\u2019d expect a tight, polished game \u2014 regardless of how well the puzzles have been designed. sadly, the persistence of one single bug severely hampers the experience. under certain conditions \u2014 and i have no idea what these conditions actually are \u2014 the box you\u2019re trying to push will, er\u2026 become transparent. and sort of not-quite-there. you can walk through it (and sometimes will, accidentally). if you\u2019re of a particular mind or will, you can abuse this to",
        "skip several levels of the game",
        "entirely. i wouldn\u2019t mind so much if it was avoidable but, sometimes, it transports you somewhere you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have reached, so you then have a dilemma: carry on and \u2018cheat\u2019, or try to get back to where you were without moving anything else, not wanting to destroy the past by messing about in the awkward future tangent you\u2019ve created.",
        "speaking of messing about with time travel, there",
        "is",
        "a supported \u2018rewind\u2019 function which feels maybe like it was tacked on without being fully thought through. it just doesn\u2019t feel balanced: you can only undo a very small number of moves and it\u2019s usually easier to just reset the level by leaving through the entrance and returning. i went through the whole game barely making any use of it.",
        "tip: if your invisible time machine runs on batteries, don\u2019t store those batteries in bushes,",
        "in the rain",
        ". that\u2019s not good battery-storage practice.",
        "so, what about the puzzles? after all, i\u2019ve managed to find fault with most other aspects of this game, how about the thing that actually matters the most?",
        "here\u2019s the first 3 (this isn\u2019t spoiling much!):",
        "they continue in much the same vein way for quite some time, but more variation slowly gets added. the main problem is typically how to move each \u2018box\u2019 without putting it in a position from which it cannot be moved. sometimes this involves moving it in an uninuitive direction. other times it involves moving multiple boxes as part of the same \u2018step\u2019. some of the levels can be tackled in reverse: work out how it\u2019s possible to move a box onto each target square, then work backwards from there.",
        "many of the puzzles are symmetrical, with half the bozes on one side, half on the other. this makes for pleasing visuals, but in terms of gameplay, it just produces two smaller, identical puzzles. it\u2019s not much fun doing the same puzzle twice, although it seems there is sometimes a concession to this \u2014 e.g. one half is upside-down, at least.",
        "it\u2019s slightly annoying that the boxes that are key to the game aren\u2019t \u2026 really boxes? am i the only one seeing that weird protrusion at the top that kinda makes them look like some kind of sleeping bag or fridge freezer. they sure aren\u2019t the thing in this picture:",
        "that\u2019s \u2026 well, it\u2019s a least a",
        "cube",
        "if not really looking quite like a box.",
        "there\u2019s a serious point to this digression: with the boxes that weird rectangle shape, it\u2019s that much more difficult to line everything up along the invisible \u2018grid\u2019 that positions it all. on several ocassions, i couldn\u2019t quite tell if there was a gap somewhere or not.",
        "so the first 20-30 levels or so are all pretty straightforward, some are downright disappointing, particularly when the solution is trivially easy, even still at this stage. but, then, there are some really well designed, fun-to-play, challenging levels. level 28, for example, was the first that really grabbed me as an excellent puzzle level. level 29, in contrast, was pedestrian \u2014 just no challenge at all. then came level 35, which was absolutely delightful, a real gem of a level.",
        "i really did feel grateful for these wonderfully well put-together levels, but overall quality was inconsistent. there must\u2019ve been about 10-15 very good levels, 30-40 almost pointless ones, and about half middling.",
        "i\u2019ll finish on a high point, with one of the best levels in the game. the boxes here have to be pushed through the bottom channel, but getting them all into that space is tricky\u2026",

        "i\u2019m a bit confused by this game. it has lots of flaws i could point at across the board. the only area in which it\u2019s totally free from criticism, really, is visually: the graphics are clean, attractive, funny, just enough to add some colour to the gameplay without distracting from it.",
        "but, despite all the areas in which it falls slightly short, i still enjoyed playing the game. it was fun to pick up, play a few levels of, then move onto something else. i played the last 40-50 levels in one sitting, and that was fun, too. it\u2019s a good handheld game, perfect for travel. it\u2019s sorely in need of some better level design, though.",
