        "review \u2014 the idea is that i can try out a lot more games this way and, hopefully, find some gems worth checking out in further detail. i\u2019ll try to get it written in record time, but still cover the basics of what each game is actually about, as well as what is enjoyable \u2014 or not \u2014 about it.",
        "yellow fins",
        "is a very classic kind of \u2018one button\u2019 mobile game, in which you play something that slides along an ever-scrolling ground, but can also leave it and achieve flight. hold down the button (b) to pull yourself to the ground, release it to lift off. collect coins along the ground, and aim for the best score \u2014 i guess.",

        "looks pretty nice \u2014 if you can deal with the feeling the main character is ripped-off straight from",

        ". it seems to play reasonably well, and the concept is easy-to-grasp, so this is a simple game to get into, to pick up and play.",
        "er, that\u2019s about it, though. this really is a mobile game \u2014 one you might expect to pick up for free on a phone, but not one you\u2019d ever expect to be sold in a box for a home console. so, whether this kind of thing appeals to you will depend, in part, on how you view the switch itself: as a casual mobile gaming device, or a proper \u2018full-grown\u2019 console. personally, i go with the latter, so games like",

        "two",
        "levels really isn\u2019t enough to be judging a game on. so, this demo must utterly fail on those grounds. unless it\u2019s actually an amazing demo in the sense that it accurately reflects the final game. in either case, i won\u2019t be following this one up."
