        "underbite",
        "may be \u2018just another platformer\u2019, but it\u2019s clear from the outset\n    that care and attention has gone into its creation so far. from",
        "the attractive itch.io page",
        "to the in-game graphics, everything looks clean and inviting. and, wherever you stand on the nature of \u2018cute\u2019 in\n    video games, it\u2019s hard to deny just how charming the little dino fella is, with his underbite and \u2018snoozing\u2019 animation.",
        "neutralise",
        "anyway, i mustn\u2019t fixate on that \u2014 there\u2019s gameplay to be had!",
        "bda",
        "is seeped in familiarity: simple controls, enemies to jump on, meat to collect instead of coins, boxes that contain more of the same, sometimes hearts. everything here is straightforward, and introduced at a leisurely pace in the first 5 or so levels. the key mechanic to note at this point is the completion condition: most levels require you to \u2018kill\u2019 (neutralise? they seem to just turn into statues) all enemies.",
        "backtracking",
        "this requirement, in conjunction with a number of tempting \u2018secret areas\u2019, leads to some backtracking and exploration from around level 6 onwards \u2014 i consider this no bad thing, particularly when it\u2019s as well-balanced as it is here.",
        "super mario bros",
        "was a great game, but we all want to try a bit of right-to-left action from time-to-time!",
        "hints at the potential of bigger, more-complicated level maps in a full version.",
        "rough",
        "as a free-to-play \u201cearly playable prototype\u201d, it\u2019s unsurprising that there are some rough edges. i found the help signs \u2014 which pull up some dialog \u2014 a bit annoying since they couldn\u2019t easily be avoided or dismissed early.",
        "mercy invincibility",
        "is present when hit, but you can\u2019t move until you\u2019re vulnerable again, which can cause some double-hits. sometimes the spin jump animation got stuck, playing endlessly. most importantly, on later levels (espcailly level 10) i seemed to succumb to a bug which inexplicably reset me to the beginning of the level at a certain point.",
        "effective",
        "however, for the most part, the game feels well-polished, in fact more so than some released titles. i\u2019m a big fan of the simple, but incredibly effective, reuse of \u2018active\u2019 platforms, in a darkened style, to represent \u2018inactive\u2019 backgrounds. it\u2019s a small point, but here it\u2019s done as close to perfection as i think i\u2019ve seen. the level-design, as far as one can tell from ~11 levels, is very well paced \u2014 this is clearly a game that will appeal to children, but it\u2019s still enjoyable enough to play for this big kid!",
        "additions",
        "i\u2019ll be interested to see if the creator feels the need to make any significant additions for a full release, in order to make this title stand out, but i\u2019m not convinced it really",
        "needs",
        "that, particularly if the bugs are ironed out, if the quality of level design can be maintained, and if the difficulty ramps up appropriately. it might genuinely just need a full set of levels to turn this into a really enjoyable, classic platformer."
