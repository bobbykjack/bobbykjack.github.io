        "in the early stages you have two pieces of gum, which allows you to blow two bubbles before needing to \u2018recall\u2019 the first. this is a novel tactic because it requires you to think not only about placement, but order \u2014 on several occasions, i thought i\u2019d done everything right and pressed the button to recall a bubble, only to realise the one i was standing on was the oldest!",

        "i found the controls slightly awkward at times \u2014 often mixing up \u2018jump\u2019 with \u2018blow\u2019 with inevitable and hilarious results. probably this was mostly due to playing on keyboard. fortunately, time is not much of a factor in the early levels, so you can take time to plan exactly where you should be spitting those bubbles next.",
        "puzzles",
        "apart from the main mechanic, we\u2019re in familiar platforming territory \u2014 spikes as hazards, actual enemies that shoot things later on, stars and life-replenishing hearts to collect. some sections have gusts of wind (?) which move the bubbles on a path and these set up small puzzles to overcome. on occasion, though, i felt i was bypassing the intended route all too easily.",

        "the final stage is an auto-scroller, thankfully with unlimited gum. this really changes the gameplay quite significantly, from a \u2018platformer with thinking\u2019 to a \u2018run! run! master those controls!!\u2019 kind of deal. i had to replay this level quite a few times before really getting to grips with it, but it certainly demonstrates a great deal of potential for varying the play. again, though, i found myself taking a few shortcuts here which certainly didn\u2019t look designed intentionally.",
