        "the flame in the flood",
        "an absorbing game which represents value for money, marred by bugs and flawed mechanics",
        "is anchored around two types of physical setting: a river, and various landing points scattered along its shoreline. the river acts as one-way navigation through",
        "ten stages",
        ", each of which has a number of locations that can be docked at. it\u2019s a dangerous stretch of water, and the unwieldy nature of your unbuffed raft often leads you to miss a landing, or inflict damage \u2014 that raft can only take about 10 hits before inevitable drowning and the end of the run. (after one-too-many annoying misses, i grew into the habit of furiously mashing the \u2018dock\u2019 button whenever i was anywhere near a landing point; mindless button pressing is not particularly interesting or challenging.)",
        "the river. and a raft. your nemeses.",
        "fortunately, the main action takes place on land, and it\u2019s a much more gratifying experience. at each landing point, you\u2019ll need to",
        "gather resources",
        ", from which you can then",
        "craft items",
        "to help you stave off the threats to your life: hunger, thirst, cold, fatigue, injury, etc. initially, your small inventory creates the main challenge: which resources you choose to prioritise, and which items you decide to create, in order to prepare for every eventuality. you\u2019ll discover that some resources you initially dismissed are a lot more useful than they seemed on first inspection.",
        "buildings can be looted for extra resources. they also offer a refuge for much-needed sleep.",
        "some of these resources are also",
        "threats",
        ", in the form of hostile wildlife: wild boar, wolves, and bears. they",
        "will",
        "attack, and they",
        "injure you (possibly fatally), so your two options are attack first or flee. by the way, the sound some of these creatures makes can be pretty intimidating, especially if you thought you were all alone! suddenly, the serene atmosphere is broken apart by snarling and howling, and you\u2019re reminded just how dangerous this world is.",
        "running away means you\u2019ll miss out on whatever resources a predator might be guarding, but attacking also uses up valuable resources in the form of traps, arrows, etc. occasionally, it turns out your best bet might be to just take a hit, then heal from the injury later.",
        "so, gather everything you can from shore, then \u2026 back to that damned raft again. it becomes reminiscent of a \u2018move the claw\u2019 arcade game: on the surface, easy and understandable, but that masks an underlying unpredictability. maybe one should learn to embrace this mechanic: for a change, we have a game that tells us \u2018you\u2019re",
        "not",
        "in control\u2019. after yet another multi-hour run is lost to an innocuous looking rock, though, it starts to grate a bit.",
        "but focussing on the \u2018white water rafting\u2019 aspect of this game would be to do it a serious disservice. it",
        "can",
        "be managed and, most importantly, it\u2019s a side-dish to the main course: a straightforward \u2014 but",
        "surprisingly deep",
        "\u2014 survival game. and, like the best survival games,",
        "provides a compelling challenge, one of \u2018just one more attempt\u2019, where starting a new run is almost more fun than making serious progress. it\u2019s the sense of \u2018i know what i did wrong, i can fix that next time\u2019 that will keep you coming back for more, time and time again.",
        "the game at its most sinister, at night, when threats abound.",
        "at its heart lies a very",
        "well-balanced",
        "game. i really",
        "like",
        "playing this game. i like that sleep is required, that fires offer several different benefits, that rain is present and annoying, but shelter is readily available. it feels",
        "realistic",
        ". and, yet, balance can only achieve so much. in the long-run,",
        "suffers from another problem often faced by survival games: how to maintain the challenge. survival games are, at their heart, all about coping with various threats, and learning how to prepare for them. once the player gets reasonably experienced, threats are all but eliminated.",
        "there\u2019s no great solution to this, i fear. it may be inherent in the survival genre \u2014 after all, you have to either die, or carry on living indefinitely. once you\u2019ve seen everything the game has to offer, neither eventuality is really that satisfying. in my first winning run, i reached the point of \u2018infinite survival\u2019 with about 3 (out of 10) regions remaining. by this point, the only remaining challenge is to navigate the river, avoiding the hazards, but also avoiding the main points of interest since there\u2019s no longer any point in gathering resources.",
        "still has several standout aspects, most of all the",
        "stunning soundtrack",
        "which really helps to evoke the solitary, tragic world the player is thrust into. the resource gathering and crafting is enjoyable, and the sense of place is greatly enhanced by unusually detailed references to",
        "nature",
        ": parasites, ants, aloe, dandelions \u2026 seriously, this must be the only game in existence that features sumac, a plant i\u2019d previously never even",

        "of!",
        "it also has some innovative mechanics: your",
        "dog companion",
        "not only provides extra inventory space, but serves as a \u2018notifier\u2019, pointing you \u2014 with an urgent bark \u2014 towards resources you might otherwise have missed.",
        "and, although there are other flaws, i consider them fairly minor: a handful of bugs, inadequate support for handheld mode (text and icons are tiny), and a pretty annoying inventory \u2014 let\u2019s face it, though, the job of an inventory is often",
        "to be",
        "annoying!",

        "ending",
        ". i\u2019ve certainly got value for money out of the game, but i feel i was \u2018lucky\u2019 not to crack the formula earlier. actually, the very fact that i perceive a \u2018formula\u2019 and i now feel like i could easily beat the game every time is a problem in itself. i",
        "want",
        "to keep playing the game, because its core gameplay is actually so enjoyable, but now i\u2019ve peeked behind the curtain, i can\u2019t quite get enthused enough to do so.",
        "right back to the beginning \u2014 a soon-to-be familiar location.",
        "the verdict",
        "\ud83d\ude30",
        "a frustrating game, both intentionally \u2014 in a good way \u2014 and due to a number of bugs and awkward mechanics. however, if you can brush aside these issues, an enjoyable, compelling experience awaits.",
