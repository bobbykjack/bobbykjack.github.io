        "about a moving story or a deep and meaningful plotline: your robotic mission is basically the classic \u2018find your friend\u2019 challenge. as the game begins, you\u2019re soon introduced to the main gameplay mechanics: wall jump, digging with your pickaxe (an action that can be traced all the way back to 1982\u2019s",

        "the main digging mechanic is a fairly unique diversion, but it doesn\u2019t offer quite enough, for me, to really be that interesting or entertaining. that said, the character handles responsively, and the friendly mapping and transport system both help to keep the momentum going.",
