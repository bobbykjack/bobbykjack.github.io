        "the game itself is a pretty standard platformer, with some common tried-and-tested devices \u2014 there\u2019s nothing particularly original here, it\u2019s just done so very well. everyone will have their own reference point, but i was reminded in particular of",

        "that boss deserves a proper mention, because it\u2019s very well done: tough, but fair. there are four different, predictable phases, and each is fairly manageable, but there\u2019s challenge in remembering which phase is next, and having to react quite differently to each.",
