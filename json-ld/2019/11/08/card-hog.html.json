        "tutorial",
        "although i\u2019m not really familiar with this style of game, it\u2019s pretty accessible, in part thanks to the short tutorial which goes over the absolute basics. it\u2019s a slight shame i couldn\u2019t skip this demo when i cam back to the game later, but it\u2019s quick, and i can hardly fault it for this since the current aim is to get people playing, even though they haven\u2019t paid for it.",

        "evils",
        "see, you\u2019ll often find yourself in a situation faced with trying to determine the lesser of two evils. or, even more interestingly, a \u2018bad\u2019 move & a \u2018good\u2019 move \u2014 which might also be a bad move in the long-run. if you\u2019re about to pick up a health card which gives you maximum health, it can be a better move to fight something first, since you have future income to repay the debt. if only i could game my own real-life finances in the same way!",
        "depth",
        "card hog is, currently, an engrossing game with plenty of potential. it has a lot of depth courtesy of the quantity of different cards \u2014 weapons that work in almost every conceivable way, a large range of mobs and bosses to destroy \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of tactical thinking required to handle all these combinations. it\u2019s very playable on mobile, too \u2014 the simple set of controls and the portrait layout lend themselves perfectly to such a device. it feels quite at home in much the same way that \u2018tile-pushers\u2019 such as",
