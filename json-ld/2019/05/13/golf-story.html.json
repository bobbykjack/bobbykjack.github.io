        "a quirky combination of sports game and rpg produces a highly original and entertaining result",
        "the title",
        "really does a great job of setting expectations here: yes, this game is, indeed, a somewhat bizarre combination of golf and rpg. it\u2019s the kind of idea that you\u2019d never come up with yourself, but then makes perfect sense when you see it in action.",
        "yes, this is a rap battle. in an rpg. about golf.",
        "the underlying plot \u2014 something about following in your father\u2019s footsteps, rekindling your love of the sport \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly important: you\u2019re here to play golf, and get better at playing golf. but it quickly introduces the two main gameplay functions, and demonstrates just how well they can be integrated.",
        "as an rpg, there are tones of",
        "link to the past",
        "\u2014 and countless other top-down, 2d adventure games \u2014 in style. it\u2019s another pixely homage to the 16-bit era, which is very well suited to both golf and rpg, in my book; give me a sports game that looks like",
        "sensible soccer",
        "or an rpg imitating",
        "lttp",
        ", and you\u2019re halfway to a sale already. the characters are well animated, and combined with the humorous dialogue, do a great job of adding personality to the game.",
        "you set off in a world of unknown size (although it\u2019s not spoiling too much to reveal there are a total of 8 \u2018areas\u2019), in which some parts are locked. non-player characters abound and are eager to draw you into their own personal side-stories. tasks range from honing your golf skills, to finding certain items and locating other characters. one longer sequence is practically a \u2018mini adventure\u2019 game, which i really enjoyed.",
        "on occasion, though, i found the typical side-quests lacking.",
        "finds a way to shoehorn a great number of diversions into the main golfing theme \u2014 digging up treasure with your golf club, for example \u2014 but when these are repeated several times, they can verge on feeling like a bit of a chore. admittedly, i did go out of my way to finish many of these optional tasks, so i clearly didn\u2019t find them",
        "too much",
        "of a drag.",
        "much of the dialog consists of other people insulting you in various amusing ways!",
        "the golf game works in a classic \u2018arcade\u2019-style: easy controls which adopt the almost universal \u2018power and accuracy\u2019 bar which starts on your first press, gets more powerful the longer you wait for the second press, then gives you a small duration in which to press one final time, to set accuracy. it\u2019s an interface that works absolutely as expected, and can be understood pretty much straight away.",
        "having said that, there\u2019s quite a bit of depth underneath, should you choose to explore it: different clubs (of course), but also spin, various power settings and refinements, and a whole bunch of skills that can be upgraded with experience points won. as i\u2019ve implied, though, it\u2019s not really",
        "necessary",
        "to get too bogged down by complex settings. most of the time, you can just play using the basic actions, and you\u2019ll progress just fine.",
        "you can practise any kind of shot, even \u2018off course\u2019, ideal for honing those tactics.",
        "each location contains its own course, with various unique hazards, including moles that grab your ball if it gets too close, crocodiles that swallow your ball, slippery ice, etc. these are, of course, in addition to the staple golf hazards of water, bunkers, and various grass types. the extra hazards come across as a bit \u2018gimmicky\u2019, but they might help add variety for anyone not completely convinced by the standard golf play.",
        "the golf playing was fun but i liked it most when playing for longer sessions. anything under an hour, and i felt i was just relearning some of the techniques i\u2019d learnt previously, only to then stop. longer sessions enabled me to hone those skills and actually improve. and i wish there was a way to cancel a shot \u2014 every now and then, i\u2019d accidentally start my swing when setting it up, and have no option but to play out a terrible shot.",
        "in general, this is not a difficult game. the rpg is not completely linear, but it\u2019s constrained enough that you\u2019re never left feeling stuck with no idea of what to do next. but when it comes to the golfing, the final course really steps things up a gear. water everywhere, constantly changing wind, a par",
        "six",
        "hole: it all conspires against you. i really found myself unprepared for this final challenge. although the side quests do a great job of training the player across all gameplay aspects, up until the end, i think the use of various skills during main play itself is under-required. the first seven courses tend towards the easier end of the scale, so they don\u2019t really encourage mastery until it\u2019s absolutely required.",
        "that final course, and its difficulty, helps to emphasise all the details of the golf gameplay that might have been previously overlooked. however, in doing so, it highlights just how much rng is (seemingly) involved. this is fair \u2014 like any sport, there is an element of luck involved in golf, so it seems reasonable to simulate that, too \u2014 but i",
        "did",
        "find this frustrating when challenged to perform at the highest level. it took me maybe 20 attempts to finally beat, and it felt like it was going to take a lot longer!",
        "a chip-in eagle is",
        "highly",
        "satisfying (note the range of options and info provided by the ui)",
        "the most obvious fault to pick might be a predictable one: whilst the combination of these two genres is highly original, and the result is a well-polished, enjoyable game, it\u2019s not going to be \u2018best in class\u2019 either as an rpg or a sports game. in particular, the rpg feels a little \u2018light\u2019 \u2014 i would have loved to have seen one or two extra extended challenges, having been teased by the single bit of significant rpg action that is on show here. the golfing didn\u2019t entirely convince me that i was getting much better or that my judgement was improving; too often, it felt like luck (usually bad!) was playing a part. it\u2019s a shame, too, that video capture isn\u2019t supported, so your greatest shots will have to remain a memory.",
        "but",
        "is, at its heart, a silly, challenging, novel experience, one which i would highly recommend to any switch owner, especially those with an affinity for retro gaming. at its price-point, it represents excellent value for money.",
        "the verdict",

        "although an exclusive,",
        "is not the individual game you\u2019ll ever buy a nintendo switch",
