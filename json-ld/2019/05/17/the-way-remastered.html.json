        "the way remastered",
        "has some problems, but it pays homage to a certain style of challenging action platformer very well indeed",
        "is full of nostalgia, from the pixelated landscape, to the lucasarts-esque typography, and the 2.5d perspective. it faithfully recreates the look and feel of the 16-bit, amiga platform so perfectly, that old-school fans such as myself can\u2019t help but be delighted right from the off.",
        "the first thirty seconds are really just intro, but they at least demonstrate some of the beautiful pixel graphics on show",
        "the graphics have clearly been lovingly created, and the backdrops of these alien worlds are \u2018painted\u2019 gorgeously, but some of the character artwork and animation (of the \u2018assistant\u2019 character, in particular) could have been more polished. i loved the way text labels faded into view as i got closer to the relevant object, and the viewport scrolled to reveal doors opened by switches that were far, far away \u2014 these little touches go a long way.",
        "i\u2019d say at least 75% of the puzzles were engaging, and a good level of difficulty; some, unfortunately, were a let-down. at worst, the real challenge was understanding how the puzzle worked, rather than solving it. on one or two occasions, i gave up and \u2018brute forced\u2019 them by trial-and-error, which isn't too much fun, nor is it the sign of a well-designed puzzle. but the puzzles that work, especially the highly inventive tasks based around skills that you gain, are good fun if you like a bit of cognitive exercise.",
        "it\u2019s the age-old story of one man digging up his dead wife in an attempt to reanimate her \u2026",
        "i adore the multi-genre aspect of this game. it\u2019s so reminiscent of the amiga era, i can\u2019t imagine the creator wasn\u2019t influenced by that platform. i'm concerned the combination might feel too odd to some, but i really enjoyed the switching from one form to another. and the ending section switches the gameplay up once more, which surprised me, but left a smile on my face.",
        "much has been made of the story which, admittedly, is well told and moving on occasion. but we\u2019re not talking",
        "hollow knight",
        "levels of depth and characterisation here \u2014 this is a short action game, primarily.",
        "some of the platforming takes frustration to a new level. i\u2019m not sure how intentional that is, but it borders, at times, on masochistic. if you fall from about three times your own height, you die; call me wild and reckless, but i don\u2019t think that would",
        "quite",
        "be the case irl. some of the gaps that require you to jump",
        "only a little bit",
        "but not",
        "the-smallest-you-can are incredibly fiddly. and i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever played a game in which descending a ladder is so awkward.",
        "throughout the game, various memories can be \u2018examined\u2019 to reveal background to the plot, a technique also seen in",
        "the legend of zelda: breath of the wild",
        "the final genre to discuss is the combat, which usually consists of shooting, in one form or another. in a similar game from the original era, you might have utilised the d-pad (or its equivalent) to aim \u2014 nowadays, we have a full 360-degrees to work with, courtesy of the analog joystick. it takes quite a bit of getting used to \u2014 aiming with the joystick in 2d and shooting \u2014 but it\u2019s rewarding enough once you get the hang.",
        "the enemies you\u2019ll come across are varied and challenging but fair \u2014 the game is generous enough to leave them dead after one kill, most of the time. in fact, the game is also generous in restart points \u2014 which you\u2019ll find are used a",
        "lot",
        "since the platforming and combat are so tough. even though its short,",
        "has a good, balanced difficulty level, and tests the player in a variety of ways.",
        "has a very unique style and combination of gameplay genres, which might make it divisive. i fall heavily into the camp that \u2014 mainly through nostalgia \u2014 is drawn to this kind of thing, and i wasn\u2019t disappointed. i",
        "would",
        "urge caution for anyone who doesn\u2019t already suspect they\u2019d enjoy this kind of game, but those with at least a passing interest are bound to find enjoyment here. a couple of bugs let the side down a bit (one, involving a security light that becomes impossible to pass, seems consistent), but the restart mechanism at least provides an easy workaround.",
        "one of the many challenging puzzles you'll encounter; this one involves using the telekinesis ability to move five switches into the correct position",
        "the verdict",

        ", it\u2019s possibly a surprise i feel so nostalgic for this game. but it manages to get enough of the detail right, not only to recreate a memorable piece of the past, but also to add a suitable amount of flourish in the process. if a few more of the bigger downsides \u2014 length, fiddliness, some obscure puzzles \u2014 could be ironed out,",
