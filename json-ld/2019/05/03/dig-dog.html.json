        "is a fast-paced, perfectly-pitched rogue-lite, offering an addictive slice of nostalgia",
        "right from the title screen,",
        "announces itself as a work of great affection for the past, specifically for the golden age of video-gaming. big blocky pixels, bright colours from a small palette, rhythmic chiptunes; the game calls back to 80s arcade games (and their home computer ports) more than anything.",
        "dig dug",
        "is the obvious title to draw comparison with.",
        "that spikey thing to your left will kill you. that spikey thing to your right will kill you, too!",
        "the main gameplay here is straightforward enough to explain quickly. each level is maybe one-and-a-half screens wide, and three or four screens tall. you (as the titular dog) start at the top, and have to make your way to the single bone contained underground, somewhere near the bottom. dig towards it, in various directions; avoid the enemies and static hazards; touch the bone, and progress to the next level.",
        "unsurprisingly, the game relies heavily (almost exclusively) on the digging mechanic most recently revisited by games such as",
        "steamworld dig 2",
        ". however, although i felt the mining was underused in that otherwise excellent game, here it shines. it has to really, there\u2019s nowhere else for this game to hide if it doesn\u2019t get the digging absolutely right.",
        "maybe it\u2019s the overall game style, maybe a rogue-lite just suits this mechanic better than a metroidvania. but i think it\u2019s more than that, i think \u2014 somehow \u2014",
        "manages to create a more interesting challenge from this core action, despite the random nature of its procedural generation. playing",
        "frequently left me feeling like i could tunnel anywhere and it didn\u2019t really matter too much, as long as i was moving in the correct general direction. here, we have a game that really makes you consider where you\u2019re going, fully exploiting the puzzle aspects that arise from the nature of digging.",
        "another theme; the contrast",

        "actually make a difference when spotting well-disguised enemies",
        "time and time again, i find myself facing some kind of \u2018mini-puzzle\u2019, a certain arrangement of enemies, fixed hazards, and terrain that actually has to be solved, rather than merely traversed. that these arise from procedural generation is a testament to the level of detail that must have gone into planning whatever rules determine the layout.",
        "it makes for highly tactical gameplay. you",
        "attempt to rapidly drill down through the earth, like a canine possessed, an approach that",
        "sometimes",
        "works \u2014 and is highly satisfying, to boot! but most of the time, some obstacle or another will not only prevent you from doing that, but will inevitably lead to your death instead. it\u2019s very easy to misread your location and end up digging through to the spiky, deadly floor.",
        "death is ever-present. with just two fragile health points (upgrades excepted), the challenge is often a balance between tactics and patience. at least you\u2019re not kept waiting; unlike",
        "new super mario bros u deluxe",
        ", for example, restarting is not a painful, drawn-out process. this matters for a game \u2014 and genre \u2014 that demands \u2018just one more quick go\u2019.",
        "i think, above all, it\u2019s the enemy detail that makes this game so challenging. in the same way that",
        "pac-man",
        "\u2019s ghosts were both simple in their rules, but apparently complex in their resulting behaviour,",
        "\u2019s enemies serve their purpose very well. there\u2019s enough variation and unpredictability here to ensure a certain level of skill is absolutely necessary. you can\u2019t just blaze through these levels, however much it seems like you should be able to. and the varying enemy behaviour means there are no easy options: there doesn\u2019t appear to be any kind of reliable pattern that you can dig in to guarantee safety.",
        "the graphics lend quite a distinct style to the game, although, for me, they bring to mind a much-loved game from the 1980\u2019s: alley cat. particularly the \u2018wave dog\u2019 palette. there\u2019s also some adorable animation here: little touches such as the dog wagging its tail or looking over its shoulder are subtle enough to be missed in the heat of the action, but they contribute to an overall humorous and approachable atmosphere.",
        "level select (seriously, this screenshot could be from a 30-year old ms-dos game \u2014 and i love that!)",
        "i\u2019m struggling to find criticisms here, but i\u2019m also aware that i\u2019ve only played",
        "for a few hours so far. there is undoubtedly more play time to be had, i\u2019m just not sure whether it\u2019s another few hours or considerably more. in particular, i\u2019m reminded of how i felt when i first played",
        "gonner",
        ", a similar rogue-lite that i picked up when my switch first arrived, as i was killing time, waiting for",
        "breath of the wild",
        ". i played a lot of",
        "(a similar game, but with shooting instead of digging), and thoroughly enjoyed it but, in retrospect, i think it just became a little bit too repetitive to persevere with for any longer. now,",
        "feels like it\u2019s sidestepped that issue by creating enough variety in its early levels, and by pitching its difficulty at a",
        "slightly",
        "more forgivable level.",
        "another small problem i have is the lack of explanation. case in point: there appears to be a control that \u2018barks\u2019 (or bites?) which actually doesn\u2019t do anything. it\u2019s not that i have a problem with that \u2014 it\u2019s cute and a funny distraction \u2014 but it would be nice to know if it really is \u2018useless\u2019 or if i\u2019m missing something! likewise, some of the upgrades that can be purchased (alongside a bigger jump, more health) are pretty obscure; it\u2019s not immediately obvious what effect, if any, they\u2019re having.",
        "the verdict",

        "they\u2019ll either complete the key challenge quickly, or become frustrated at the face of a difficulty cliffside.",
        "personally, i appear to hit the sweet spot in the middle, where neither of these problems manifest. i\u2019m keen to get back to the game and continue making progress. and, even if this game doesn\u2019t sustain my interest for an enormous amount of time, it\u2019s a delightful ride while it lasts. for the low price point, it offers great value for money.",
