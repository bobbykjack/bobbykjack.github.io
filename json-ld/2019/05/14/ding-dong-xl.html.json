        "about. it does, however, offer addictive, challenging gameplay for those with a strong competitive streak.",
        "this is the second one-button game i\u2019ve got on the switch, after",
        "super one more jump",
        ". that game is an \u2018endless runner\u2019, but i\u2019d hesitate to call",
        "that, even if it \u2026 sort of is? an \u2018endless batter\u2019, maybe.",
        "anyway, these types of game typically require least in manual dexterity, and most in reflexes, reactions, and foresight.",
        "is exactly this:",

        "(with a lot more variation). plus power-ups.",
        "it\u2019s essentially a game of \u2018chicken\u2019, a judgement on exactly when you need to fire the ball from one side to the other, in order to avoid colliding with the junk flying across, in either direction \u2014 usually both. each piece of debris does one of a variety of different things, indicated by its colour: some expand and contract, some rotate, etc. a small number of power-ups do things like slow obstacles down, allow you to crash straight through them, or destroy all the bad stuff currently on-screen.",
        "the neon graphics, rhythmic soundtrack, and in-your-face animation remind me very much of",
        "lumines",
        "; there\u2019s always a lot going on in the background and periphery, as the game constantly tries to put you off, daring you to fail. this is a welcome refinement to the core gameplay, but it can get frustrating at times.",
        "things start off easy (although notice how obstacles are moving both left and right) \u2026",
        "also has a couple of interesting features which add interesting twists:",
        "#1 if you just wait around",

        ", as you wait, since you become more of a target.",
        "#2 if you just \u2018nick\u2019 the edge of some debris, you escape unharmed and gain a point. it\u2019s pretty difficult and dangerous to actively play for these bonuses, but it\u2019s very possible when you get the slowdown power-up. it also adds an element of forgiveness, which is unusual and very welcome indeed.",
        "\u2019s concept is so simple, it inevitably succeeds or fails on how entertaining the core gameplay and feedback loop is. and, for me at least, it does very well in this regard. when you die, you don't die unfairly. in fact, you always",
        "know",
        "you\u2019re going to die before it happens: your impending doom is obvious as soon as you\u2019ve propelled yourself towards it. it\u2019s incredibly frustrating, but has that wonderful element of convincing you that you\u2019d never make that same mistake again. runs don\u2019t last all that long anyway, and restarting is quick and painless.",
        "so, what\u2019s here is well done \u2014 there just isn\u2019t",
        "that much",
        "here. the more you play, the more stuff appears to get in your way, but nothing really changes too much. it\u2019s essentially a \u2018rinse-repeat\u2019 cycle: start, stay alive as long as you can, set a new high score, try to stay alive longer the next time, etc. it\u2019s a compelling challenge if you like setting personal bests, but it\u2019s certainly the kind of game that some will tire of pretty quickly.",
        "\u2026 and things get difficult pretty quickly (those squares move at an angle and those lines rotate).",
        "the greatest omission here is a global high-score table; for a game so focussed on points, that\u2019s a pretty big defect. i\u2019m still not sure how impressive my highscore of 231 is, although i suspect it\u2019s pretty mediocre! apparently, the developer has a",
        "high score table planned",

        "cheap, and really well executed. i hesitate to recommend something",
        "just",
