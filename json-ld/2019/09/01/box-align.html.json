        "the first level is fine: pick up a block, move it to make a matching line. note that it can be solved in a few different ways, too.",
        "here\u2019s the rub: you have an arrangement of cubes, some of which might be stacked. each turn, you pick up a block, and place it somewhere else. if your move doesn\u2019t cause a line of matching (by colour) cubes, 3 or more, then you fail. matched cubes are removed.",
        "remove all cubes to win",
        ".",
        "for some reason \u2014 and i\u2019m honestly not sure if this one\u2019s on me or the game \u2014 i couldn\u2019t quite work these rules out for ages, simple as they are. it didn\u2019t seem obvious why my game was ending when it did (i.e. when nothing matched). i also didn\u2019t appreciate that",
        "only straight-line matches",
        "counted \u2014 i kept expecting tetris shapes to match by virtue of the 4-blocks-togetherness.",
        "pay close attention to these instructions! only straight-line matches count.",
        "once i fully understood the basic rules, the game was much more fun to play \u2014 at least, i wasn\u2019t just randomly moving boxes about anymore, hoping they\u2019d match.",
        "there\u2019s a handful of",
        "special cubes",
        "including those that can\u2019t be moved, \u2018jokers\u2019 that match any colour, and locked cubes which spawn another cube when they\u2019re matched. these definitely help to add variety to the game.",
        "includes 99 different puzzles, to be completed in order. they can easily be cycled through once complete, which is a nice touch, although i didn\u2019t have much of a desire to replay any levels.",
        "the whole",
        "movement scheme is awkward",
        "\u2014 this is the first game i\u2019ve",
        "really",
        "wanted to play as vr, even more so than",
        "breath of the wild",
        ". it\u2019s just so annoying having to press all these various buttons to navigate the 3d space \u2014 in particular, i found it impossible to remember whether zl or zr moved the cursor up or down.",
        "the puzzles themselves are of mixed quality: some seem like simply trial and error; others are challenging, but fair; and many demonstrate decent use of the special blocks.",
        "but the core mechanic just ...",
        "isn\u2019t that interesting",
        ". the same-colour matching in a row has been done many times before, and the only other mechanic, really, is deciding which blocks to pick up and move, and which to leave in place, to match later.",
        "later levels introduce more complexity and extra cube types: these black-cornered ones cannot be moved themsleves.",

        "feel like a decent level design has been executed, and it\u2019s quite fun to play a challenging level when you feel like you can work it out. however, all too often it\u2019s",
        "guesswork",
        "and the premise just doesn\u2019t lend itself very well to what should be a thoughtful, challenging puzzler.",
        "the best levels are, ironically, those that are essentially 2d \u2014 i.e. with all cubes on one vertical level. when everything\u2019s visible, you have a decent chance of planning ahead and thinking through your tactics. some of my least favourite levels go as far as totally obscuring a number of cubes (one in the center of a 3*3*3 cube-of-cubes layout, for example) \u2014 what am i supposed to do here,",
        "remember",
        "the details of each cube that i can\u2019t see right now? that\u2019s not fun.",
        "and, for a game where trial-and-error is so significant, where one false move can force you to have to start all over again, an \u2018undo\u2019 feature would be a very welcome addition. time and again, i found myself making a move, then wanting to replay it to see exactly what i\u2019d done so i could plan out the remaining moves \u2014 this is just not possible.",
        "apart from the core mechanic, though, there are a few things that",
        "annoy",
        "me about the game:",
        "you can move your \u2018cursor\u2019 in all six directions, but it\u2019s not limited to the cubes available, so you can move it way above the highest cube. which is pointless.",
        "you can be in a fail state \u2014 e.g. just one cube remaining \u2014 but the game doesn\u2019t end. you have to make a final \u2018failing move\u2019, even though there\u2019s no other option.",
        "there\u2019s a notable pause between matched blocks disappearing and the cursor being movable again.",
        "the camera is \u2026 weird. you can\u2019t move it fully around and it sometimes feels like it\u2019s working against you, like it has a mind of its own. you can\u2019t zoom, although adding yet one more control probably wouldn\u2019t be great, either! as i said earlier, vr would offer a much nicer experience here!",
        "when you pick up a cube, its colour gets \u2018tinted\u2019 as an indication you\u2019re holding it. however, sometimes a cube gets tinted to the",
        "exact same colour",
        "as others, leading to confusion if you momentarily forget what\u2019s going on. thing is, there isn\u2019t even really a need to indicate you\u2019re holding the cube: you can see when you move the cursor, and no harm can come of that. so not tinting it at all would be the better move here\u2026",
        "a critical flaw: the cube with green corners is actually red, but becomes purple when \u2018picked up\u2019. the exact same purple as those purple cubes!",
