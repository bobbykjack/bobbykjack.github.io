        "slowest",
        "of play, though, and that\u2019s very much a good thing.",
        "the game is turn-based (another reason it could probably be ported to any old bit of hardware lying around) which adds to its overall air of cerebral superiority; this is a game that isn\u2019t afraid to challenge your brain in ways your brain didn\u2019t know were possible.",
