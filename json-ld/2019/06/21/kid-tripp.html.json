        "nintendo",
        "couldn\u2019t convince me to like.",
        "jump, bounce, shoot, kill, bounce, jump, die to monkey. repeat.",
        "is a game utterly without pretension, and that gives it a reasonable minimum \u2018score\u2019 alone. it never really pretends to be anything more than it is, so it's difficult to be too down on it. take its plot, for example:",
        "kid tripp has crashed on a mysterious island and now the local wildlife is out to ruin his day.",
        "that\u2019s literally it. it must be said, though, that said wildlife includes why-are-they-harmful frogs(?), cute little bunny rabbits, and owls.",
        "owls",
        ", for f***\u2019s sake \u2014 why am i being asked to shoot an",
        "owl",
        "in the face?! couldn\u2019t they have come up with some slightly more",
        "actually dangerous",
        "wildlife than this?",
        "definitely not the twitter bird, definitely as deadly as everything else that moves in this game",
        "we all know how this type of game works, and it has nothing to do with any story: move left to right, jump on platforms, avoid / jump on / shoot enemies, don\u2019t fall down. the tutorial does a great job of explaining all there is to know about the game in 30 seconds.",
        "there are just two main controls: shoot and jump, but jumping can be done to different heights. there\u2019s also a \u2018walk\u2019 button which i never used: who walks when you can run?! it\u2019s like braking in an arcade racing game: totally boring and unnecessary.",
        "whilst we\u2019re talking controls, i need to address something: the default controls suck. you might not realise they suck until you  try customising them, then realise you can do a whole lot better. with just two controls, you don\u2019t need to leave them as a and b \u2014 that makes no sense. you want to give yourself the best chance you can of hitting either control at a split-second\u2019s notice, so use one hand per control, for the love of gaming.",
        "trust me: change the d-pad up button to jump. you won\u2019t regret it.",
        "although you can customise the controls, you don\u2019t get full control: the only button you get from the left side is the up arrow. still, it\u2019s as good as any other: assign it to jump, and at least have it as an option.",
        "you\u2019ll encounter a plethora of aforementioned cute creatures as you race through each level of",
        ", and it\u2019s genuinely not easy to know if you should shoot each one or jump on its head \u2014 either course of action could have different side-effects \u2014 and there, of course, lies a lot of the challenge. for example, you might shoot a snake, only to find out half a second later that you needed to be able to jump on it to clear a gap. some enemies simply cannot be killed by jumping on them, so you need to recognise these, remember that fact in an instant, and take evasive action. so muscle memory and trial-and-error are key components of the gameplay.",
        "just get past that first rabbit, then all will be smooth sailing...",
        "another key challenge involves landing (on an enemy, a spring, etc.), then timing another jump just right, so as to jump higher. it's a tricky move to get perfectly right, but you'll need it a lot. the tutorial deals with it, but i never really managed to perfect the move, at least not for the first two worlds. i\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s just me or an overly-sensitive control.",
        "there are only 20 levels, divided into 4 worlds, but whilst the first 2 worlds are rather easy, the difficulty ramps up from there, and the later levels are genuinely challenging. each level is only about 20 seconds long, so you could complete the entire game in about 7 minutes, in theory. in practice, you'll almost certainly be playing several of these levels many tens of times over. thankfully, you're given 10 lives, restarts are almost instantaneous, and continues are infinite. this helps give the whole affair an arcade feel \u2014 i think that\u2019s a more positive description rather than calling this a \u2018mobile\u2019 game!",
        "graphics? big blocky \u2018pixels\u2019 and the use of strong colours gives the game a very amiga-like feel as far as i\u2019m concerned. they also help the sense that this is an arcade experience.",
        "the pixels may be chunky, but contrast and outlining is well used to keep things from being confusing",
        "so, how did i end up feeling about the auto-runner genre, now? to be honest, it\u2019s still not one i\u2019ll actively seek out, but",
        "has convinced me it can produce good games. classic platforming skills are very much required here, and each level is designed perfectly well to test them. the \u2018repeat/reward\u2019 loop is tweaked just right so as to maintain interest in the challenge \u2014 this includes the overall difficulty curve which is perfectly paced, and the quick restarts which really encourage just-one-more-go play. the act of taking on a challenge, and refining skills until a run is finally successful, is a well-tested formula that\u2019s successfully adhered to here.",
