        "some people look at a pixely, low-color game and dismiss it right away, either because they\u2019ve played too many similar games already, or they just don\u2019t like that aesthetic. fair enough, i get the point.",
        "others \u2014 and i usually fall more into this group, than the previous \u2014 have their retro nerve instantly delighted just looking at those screenshots.",

        "like any proper metroidvania, your task is to navigate a map with locked-off sections, gather items to unlock more, and upgrade your weaponry to take on increasingly capable enemies. it\u2019s a tested formula that isn\u2019t toyed with too much here: if you want to understand what metroidvanias are all about, i think this might be an even better appetiser than",

        ".",
        "those graphics, then. i loved them at first sight: the animation of the cat, in particular, does a brilliant job representing a real cat\u2019s movement in just a handful of pixels. and the detail in some of the backgrounds and other mobs is genuinely impressive \u2014 to achieve that with literally just two colors has to be a feat worth admiring.",
        "screenshots really don't do credit to the smooth and delightful animation \u2014 check out the first 30 seconds",
        "the robot",
        "the more i played, though, i realised that, despite creating a gorgeous style/aesthetic, reducing the color palette so drastically is not without problems. some terrain, that is actually significant in gameplay terms, was difficult to distinguish from the rest. some enemies were difficult to spot, too. now, these aren\u2019t",

        "is",
        "pretty linear, it can throw various enemies at you, whilst keeping the difficulty level within a reasonable range. most enemies are simple to deal with, but they do get more challenging towards the end. and the boss fights are genuinely difficult, which adds variety to the main game. until the very end, it has to be said \u2014 why, oh why, are the final two bosses so much easier than those that came before?",
        "the map is perfect: unvisited rooms that are accessible are marked, so navigation is not a problem",
        "the linearity is another issue for me, i\u2019m afraid. it\u2019s probably inevitable in a game this size, and i think there",

        "different routes through the game, but it very much felt as if i was being guided screen-by-screen, area-by-area. this is definitely a personal issue, though \u2014 if you\u2019re not a fan of exploring and backtracking, a bit of hand-holding can be very welcome.",
        "here\u2019s a thing, though: why are there so many empty rooms? for a game with a pretty small map anyway, rooms with nothing in them at all just feel like the devs are trolling us!",
        "already sets itself a challenge \u2014 how to create atmosphere and environment with essentially no colors \u2014 but populating the map with so many areas that don\u2019t genuinely feel distinct isn\u2019t going to help.",

        "palette-switching adds some variety to the 2-color scheme",
        "i\u2019ve seen quotes mainly of 4-5 hours for completion; it took me just over 5 hours. i\u2019m someone who likes to get a lot of time out of their games, though \u2014 hollow knight, in particular, has spoiled me on this one. 5 hours just doesn\u2019t seem enough, even with the decent potential of a re-run.",
        "it didn\u2019t really feel like 5 hours of content, either. i think, on a couple of occasions, i got a bit lost and wasted too much time working out what to do next. that might sound like it conflicts, slightly, with what i said earlier about linearity. if anything, though, getting lost in a metroidvania is more of a problem when there\u2019s only one next step then when there are multiple paths, which at least offer more of a chance to find a way forward.",
