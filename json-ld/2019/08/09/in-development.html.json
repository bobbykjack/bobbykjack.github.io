        "it occurred to me earlier today that a lot of the accounts i follow on twitter are game developers, posting snippets of work-in-progress. some of these are inspirational, many just leave me thinking \u201chow on earth can they be so productive when all i\u2019m doing here is scrolling through twitter?\u201d",
        "so, i\u2019m going to do a quick round-up of things i\u2019m following, and looking forward to, particularly those that might be a bit \u2018under the radar\u2019 but, really, just the things that pique my interest at a given point in time.",

        "gruesome deaths, comical slapstick, and a feeling of impending danger are on show, and if the dystopian plotline can be delivered alongside a game that is genuinely as fun to play as it looks, mob could be a considerable sleeper hit.",

        "on the other hand, the gameplay remains a bit of a mystery. piawk is described as an \u201cadventure / puzzle / platformer\u201d which sounds just my cup of tea. some of the puzzles we\u2019ve seen snippets of appear to rely on physics, but there also seems to be an intriguing \u2014 and adorable \u2014 \u201cchirp\u201d action which sends musical notes out of our beak \u2026 to *some* effect \u2026",
