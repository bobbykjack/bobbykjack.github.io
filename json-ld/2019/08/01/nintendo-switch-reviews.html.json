        "i\u2019ve",
        "bought 79 switch games",
        "and i\u2019m slowly working through reviewing them all. i try to complete each game before reviewing it, where that\u2019s possible. i\u2019ve also written",
        "some much shorter reviews",
        "for demos and other freely available games.",
        "yooka-laylee and the impossible lair",
        "this 2d platformer has bags of flexibility and variety, with great\n                level design, although its gimmicks don\u2019t hit home 100% of the\n                time.",
        "xeodrifter",
        "this metroidvania is minimal in every way, but manages to\n            deliver a great gameplay experience by focussing on the\n            essentials.",
        "ministry of broadcast",
        "big brother meets \u2026 big brother. in this pixellated tale of dystopian reality game show, you\u2019re tasked with completing a series of platforming puzzles \u2014 by fair means or foul.",
        "spiritfarer",
        "spiritfarer is a captivating game with exploration, crafting, and platforming elements, woven around the moving stories of its characters.",
        "pixboy",
        "a retro platformer with enough modern touches to make it wonderfully playable.",
        "the adventures of elena temple",
        "a game steeped in nostalgia that will delight old-timers but frustrate modern gamers",
        "animal crossing: new horizons",
        "animal crossing is compelling and frustrating, a modern day doll\u2019s house with too little to do, that will probably still have you coming back time and time again.",
        "yoku\u2019s island express",
        "yoku\u2019s island express is a bewitching combination of arcade pinball mechanics and enchanting metroidvania. but is it more than the sum of its parts, or does the gimmick result in a game which falls short of the two genres\u2019 potential?",
        "super box land demake",
        "this great-looking sokoban-like has some excellent levels, but too few of them.",
        "baba is you",
        "baba is game. mechanics are modifiable. game is fun and challenging.",
        "box align",
        "is a 3d game stuck in a 2d world. its core mechanic suffers as a result, and it doesn\u2019t have enough redeeming features to make up for it.",
        "celeste",
        "answers the question \u2018how can you make a plot really work in a video game?\u2019. it\u2019s a question we should all be asking more often, particularly when this is the answer.",
        "kid tripp",
        "despite an aversion for auto-runners, i found",
        "enjoyable, if on the short side.",
        "gato roboto",
        "is adorable, and ideally suited to nostalgic handheld play, but \u2014 cute graphics aside \u2014 fails to be really memorable",
        "the way remastered",
        "has some problems, but it pays homage to a certain style of challenging action platformer very well indeed",
        "ding dong xl",
        "couldn\u2019t be simpler, so it\u2019s hard to love, but easy to enjoy",
        "golf story",
        "a quirky combination of sports game and rpg produces a highly original and entertaining result",
        "dig dog",
        "dig dog is a fast-paced, perfectly-pitched rogue-lite, offering an addictive slice of nostalgia",
        "steamworld dig 2",
        "a joy to play and a perfect introduction to the metroidvania genre",
        "the flame in the flood",
        "an absorbing game which represents value for money, marred by bugs and flawed mechanics",
        "updates",
        "subcribe to this",
        "rss feed of all nintendo switch reviews",
        "to get\n    regular updates, or follow me on twitter",
