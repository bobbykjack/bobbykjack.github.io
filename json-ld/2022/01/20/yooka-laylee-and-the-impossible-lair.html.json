        "gimmick #1: the impossible lair",
        "right at the beginning, after a brief tutorial explaining how bees can help you, the game introduces the titular lair, which is also the final level. however, it turns out that \u2018final\u2019, in this case, is in the eye of the beholder. see, you can tackle this final level at any point in the game, and finish up whenever you want\u2014if you can beat it.",
        "you",
        ", but don\u2019t. seriously, save your sanity and get as many bees as you can first!",
        "the reason",
        "not",
        "to jump straight in\u2014apart from not wanting to waste your money ignoring 95% of the game, of course\u2014is because the impossible lair is, unsurprisingly, very difficult. it\u2019s so challenging that you\u2019re expected to take many hits just trying to get through it, with the bees you collect in the game\u2019s normal levels each providing you, in effect, with one health point. there are 48 bees available to collect in total, but even with that many passes, the impossible lair is still a mighty challenge.",
        "it\u2019s a bold move making this final level available at any point, and it\u2019s not without side-effects that i\u2019ll cover later on in this review. but it\u2019s certainly a strong gimmick and, like many of the game\u2019s other twists and turns, it helps to join up all the dots in a satisfying manner. the impossible lair is, notably, the only level in the game that features boss fights, which is a minor innovation in itself.",
        "search for more bees,",
        "obviously",
        ". come on, it\u2019s a no-brainer\u2026",
        "just as the game encourages you to do, i\u2019m going to leave the impossible lair at this point and return to it at the end. it\u2019ll close things out nicely.",
        "gimmick success rating: ?/5",
        "gimmick #2: laylee",
        "laylee is a classic sidekick. while you directly control yooka, a chameleon with a talent for rolling, laylee is the female bat forever perched on your shoulders. she\u2019s rarely the star of the show but, when called upon, laylee will help you out of many a jam.",
        "laylee has two great powers. first up, she provides a safety net, absorbing one hit and allowing yooka to carry on going. when you",
        "are",
        "hit, though, laylee gets kinda spooked, flailing around mostly on the periphery of your reach. catch laylee, and it\u2019s as if nothing happened. lose laylee, however, and you\u2019re vulnerable to the next hit: yooka just can\u2019t take the heat without his partner.",
        "it\u2019s a great little mechanic, however frustrating trying to catch laylee might be. i think even real-life bats are probably easier to catch than this. thankfully, there are a number of bells\u2014some in plain sight, some hidden\u2014which will \u2018restore\u2019 laylee to your side upon contact. i guess that, even though laylee might get freaked out on occasion, her hearing can still do a job from afar. having this backup means you\u2019re encouraged to take risks and go a little faster than you otherwise might, and who can complain about that?",
        "the game\u2019s cartoony dialogs are clearly designed, to stand out from quite a busy look.",
        "laylee\u2019s other great purpose is to add a couple of actions to your moveset, namely a mario-esque twirl and a, er, mario-esque ground-pound. as a result, losing laylee restricts your movement a bit, so the levels all have to be designed for this possibility. therefore, twirl and ground-pound are never really required, they just make things a lot easier, and open up access to a few secrets respectively. this kind of optional variety is something that",
        "returns to time and time again, and it\u2019s one of the major plus points of the game.",
        "both powers also help you obtain feathers, the game\u2019s main in-level currency. they\u2019re not always lying about, either: many are spawned by special feathers you interact with in a few different ways. again, the variety adds a bit more interest beyond just the standard collectathon. feathers are used to buy upgrades, another gimmick i\u2019ll cover shortly.",
        "gimmick success rating: 4/5",
        "gimmick #3: coin challenges and paywalls",
        "like many games in this genre, each level in",
        "contains a small number of collectibles lying off the beaten path. here, these are big coins, hardly an original concept. the innovation comes in how they\u2019re used, which is integral to how you\u2019ll choose to play the game.",
        "paywalls start off cheap, but fail to collect too many t.w.i.t. coins, and you\u2019ll start having to backtrack pretty early on.",
        "levels are revealed in groups of three, in different areas of the map. but each area is, by default, inaccessible until you pay to lower a literal paywall\u2014jokes! the number required gets progressively larger, but it\u2019s always pitched at a decent level, a compromise between having to grind every last coin and being able to just rush through ignoring them.",
        "this approach does offer flexibility, however. you can take on each level methodically, trying to get all five coins as you go, and progress in a strictly linear fashion. or you can speed through, picking up coins wherever you happen upon them, only to backtrack later and replay earlier levels. the style you adopt is totally up to you; i guess most players will go for some kind of compromise, as i did myself.",
        "collecting all five coins gives you a burst of confetti at the stage end, but it\u2019s the overall progress this allows that\u2019s the real reward.",
        "some may balk at the concept of backtracking, particularly when it\u2019s enforced in order to make progress on the main path of the game. but fear not:",
        "has some great ideas on how to mitigate the monotony of repitition.",
        "gimmick #4: an array of upgrades",
        "another type of collectible, tonics are available in the hub world (and more on this in a minute). these are upgrades you can switch in and out to modify your build, something we\u2019re used to from other genres (metroidvania, roguelikes) but less so in straight left-to-right platformers. tonics have to be discovered",
        "and then bought",
        "using the feather currency.",
        "there\u2019s a large number of tonics, broken down into two types: functional and decorative. the functional type include things like an auto-feather-gatherer, longer invincibility when hit, and a triple-twirl. there\u2019s even a series of penalty tonics which do things like reverse the controls or make enemies harder to kill. both types make sense because they affect a feather multiplier which alters the total number of feathers you pick up during a level.",
        "visual effects from decorative tonics include various display ratios, colour changes, and even a heavy pixel filter.",
        "holy pixels. many of the more interesting visual-effect tonics make levels pretty difficult to navigate, so you can only really use them if you\u2019re pretty familiar with the layout already.",
        "the idea, presumably, is to make backtracking and replaying levels a bit less repetitive. it works, to an extent. the tonics are quite expensive, and you only get three slots for the most part. the feather-gatherer is just a permanent fixture for me, so there\u2019s not a lot of wiggle room. and the visual effects, while a nice novelty, often change the look a bit",
        "too",
        "much, becoming something of a distraction. some of these affect the characters themselves, amd are more appealing\u2014i wish there were more of them.",
        "in general, the tonics are a great little bonus, but few of them are useful enough to repay the effort required to obtain them.",
        "gimmick success rating: 3/5",
        "gimmick #5: the hub-world",
        "ok, this is it, the one gimmick to bind them. hub worlds can sometimes come across as a bit of an afterthought, particularly for indies or games on a smaller budget. not in this case.",
        "goes in hard on its hub world and, for me, the effort pays off gloriously. it\u2019s a top-down, 3d, fixed-camera map, much like the hub-world in",
        "super mario 3d world",
        "but, er, 3d. as in: height really is a factor, you can reach different vertical levels, that third dimension is actually a thing.",
        "the map uncovers with your starting point at the centre, and pathways appear that link back to previous areas, keeping everything nicely within reach.",
        "but, far more importantly, it contains puzzles and side-quests galore, and all those tonics i mentioned earlier. this map also unifies the levels, of course. it means it\u2019s pretty big, but you can zip from level-to-level without having to walk manually\u2014something i unfortunately didn\u2019t discover until i\u2019d played a good few hours and wasted a lot of time trudging around! never mind, i didn\u2019t once get sick of exploring this hub world, as it\u2019s full of secrets and free feathers and all sorts of stuff.",
        "every now and again, you\u2019ll encounter a cave or a tunnel leading to a mini-puzzle that reveals a bonus tonic or unlocks a level\u2019s counterpart. yes, each of the 20 levels has a second version, and these are implemented with a great big bundle of creativity. some levels transform into flooded versions of their standard layout. others add ice, flip the world upside-down, or change into a vertical climb to the finish.",
        "besides this, the variety of levels is already huge, with chase sequences and non-linear challenges thrown into the mix. honestly,",
        "gives the impression that the developers just thought \u201clet\u2019s just chuck everything we can think of in here\u201d but, importantly, they spent time making sure it all worked really well together.",
        "the hub world is stuffed full of puzzles. they\u2019re all pretty basic tasks that won\u2019t tax your grey matter too much, but they help mix up the action.",
        "if you\u2019re looking for just 2d platform level after 2d level, you might find the hub world an unwanted diversion, but i welcomed it wholeheartedly. i sometimes found myself having spent a whole half hour after starting the game, still wandering around the hub world without playing a single 2d level. it\u2019s that enticing.",
        "gimmick success rating: 5/5",
        "un-bee-lievable",
        "so, once you\u2019ve conquered as many of the game\u2019s 20 levels as you can, and gathered as many of the 48 bees as possible, it\u2019s time to return to that lair. this is the point at which the game becomes something utterly different from everything that\u2019s gone before. the experience is about one part mesmerising to two parts soul-destroying.",
        "see, the impossible lair really is much,",
        "much",
        "harder than the rest of the game, even though the later standard levels get a bit trickier. the lair is",
        "long",
        "; even the fastest speedrunners take over 10 minutes to conquer its 5 parts, and typical players will take, realisitcally, about twice as long to see it through from start to end.",
        "but that will only be after many, many failed attempts. i took 60. i\u2019ve seen others take quite a few more. now, granted, i spent a lot of time trying to play the checkpoint system; mercifully, there still is one, although this mammoth level only has four of them in total, and they don\u2019t restore lost bees. these checkpoints are essentially indefinite, recording your best attempt so you can pick it up from a later stage at any point.",
        "my final stats. the remaining five bees are all secrets which i became too impatient to hunt down. the final figure tells you i took 60 attempts to conquer the \u2018impossible\u2019 lair. wait\u2026 why\u2019s it labelled \u2018not so imposible\u2019? oh, \u2026",
        "all this means the final level will test you in ways unlike anything else in the game. it\u2019s a shame the previous levels don\u2019t really prepare you for it, and the challenge ramps up like a rollercoaster. i",
        "did",
        ", however, find myself persevering to finish it, unlike that final boss in",
        "metroid dread",
        ", so i guess there must\u2019ve been enough to keep me engaged.",
        "don\u2019t worry, bee happy",
        "the impossible lair isn\u2019t the only flaw here, unfortunately, but the game builds up enough goodwill elsewhere to sustain a found downsides. loading screens, especially from cold, are excruciatingly long. the game has a few bugs relating to collision detection and, on one occasion, it soft-locked me during a boss battle when capital b just straight up fled the scene, leaving me alone in a locked room. the in-level graphics are gorgeous, but some of the hub-world characters (especially the pagies and the trolleys) felt a bit out of place.",
        "but these don\u2019t really detract too much from the overall experience, and you shouldn\u2019t let them put you off.",
        "is a rip-roaring adventure with too many ideas in the main game for you to ever get bored. the main platforming fare is 2d fun at its finest, really up there with the best. the level design is top-notch, and the amount of secrets, diversions, and extras will keep you entertained, at least until that final level of torture.",
        "and, to be fair, you can\u2019t really say that title didn\u2019t warn you\u2026",
        "\u2026 the",

        "is a very solid platformer at its core, with an enormous amount of extras layered around it. those additions lend the game a wonderful flexibility and create a huge variety of gameplay. not every gimmick hits home perfectly, particularly the primary selling point, the impossible lair. but as an overall package,",
        "is a quality platformer, right up there with some of those it imitates. even nintendo could learn from the best-in-class hub.",
        "it\u2019s a shame about the difficulty level. the step up in challenge at the conclusion feels out-of-place. if you\u2019re a highly-skilled player, or have the patience of a saint, it\u2019s unlikely to be a serious problem. but don\u2019t get lulled into a false sense of security; this is one bee with a serious sting in its tail!",

        "on nintendo switch for just under",
        "23 hours",
        ". a decent chunk of this time was spent backtracking and in the lair, but the game has so much to occupy you with, especially if you go all-in on the 100% challenge, that it\u2019s easy to soak up time in its world.",
