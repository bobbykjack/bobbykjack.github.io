        "this metroidvania is minimal in every way, but manages to\ndeliver a great gameplay experience by focussing on the essentials.",
        "the \u2018overworld\u2019 screen allows travel between the four settings, although the order in which you\u2019ll do everything is relatively fixed.",
        "i have a confession. i\u2019ve never played a metroid game. i know, i know: hand in my gaming card, how can i even pretend to have any credibility when it comes to reviewing video games, right? and it gets worse: even though i\u2019ve played one or two entries in the castlevania series, i haven\u2019t even played symphony of the night, the one that lent its suffix to the metroidvania genre that i\u2019ve become so fond of.",
        "it\u2019s a cross i\u2019ll just have to bear for now \u2014 at least until i can be bothered to play them on nso. for now, though, i\u2019m thinking",
        "is a pretty decent substitute, at least for the original metroid.",
        "this snail is one of a handful of regular, trickier enemies.",
        "xeodrifter is ultra-minimal yet, if my understanding of metroid is even slightly accurate (gained as it was from a quick few minutes scanning a gameplay video), still manages to improve on the old 8-bit games it pays homage to in some key respects.",
        "first off, while its graphics are still all chunky pixels and limited colour palettes, it\u2019s at least brighter and more refined than its nes counterpart. backgrounds are more detailed \u2014 something which actually becomes relevant later in the game \u2014 and plenty of smooth animation helps to refine the experience.",
        "but, far more importantly, there\u2019s a level of usability that, understandably, simply wasn\u2019t present 35 years ago. it\u2019s all the little things that add up to make an experience enjoyable: proper saving \u2014 checkpoints, even! \u2014 fewer moments of sheer frustration, a better explanation of what the heck\u2019s going on.\ni don\u2019t want to spend this entire review bagging on metroid, though, so i\u2019ll stop with the comparisons about now. what really matters is how xeodrifter plays today, not how it compares with some game that\u2019s older than half the world\u2019s population. and, as far as i\u2019m concerned, xeodrifter plays really well.",
        "another slightly trickier enemy, but it can\u2019t really cope with you ducking \u2026",
        "it\u2019s an excellent size for a game, more a mini-metroidvania than a vast, sprawling behemoth like hollow knight. this is one you could polish off in a weekend \u2014 heck, even a long single sitting, if that\u2019s how you roll. i chose to break it into 2 or 3 sessions, but it had me gripped enough to pull me back each time, at the expense of anything more substantial vying for my attention.",
        "the setting is not much to get excited about. despite four unique environments, which do have some interesting properties to differentiate them, everything looks a bit too generic to really stand out. but that\u2019s no great loss since it focuses everything on your main task: exploring the map, collecting the upgrades, opening up previously inaccessible routes, and fighting a series of bosses until completion. actually, the same boss, which somehow learns new moves each time you face it. god knows why it doesn\u2019t just unleash its final attack on you during the first encounter, preferring to give you the opportunity to learn how to deal with it gradually, over a series of meet-ups. well, it\u2019s obvious of course: gameplay wins over plot or logical immersion.",
        "the boss is much more of a challenge. curiously, i found its first appearance trickier than any of the other times we met to do battle.",
        "and xeodrifter just about nails its gameplay, a few minor complaints aside. first, it balances everything \u2018just so\u2019. given that it\u2019s a short game, it introduces a generous number of upgrades, making good use of the classic \u2018open up previously unavailable areas mechanic\u2019 to great effect. one power-up in particular is very nicely implemented: the \u2018layer switcher\u2019. this allows you to move between foreground and background, transitioning between the two layers to explore paths that are only passable via one route or the other. it makes excellent use of the constrained map and it\u2019s a really nice visual effect to boot.",
        "some of the other main upgrades are less inspiring, but they all serve a useful purpose, whether it\u2019s navigating water with the submarine, or sprinting across the hazardous pink goo. alongside these abilities come upgrades to your gun, and \u2014 again \u2014 the system here is simple but the game makes the most of it. upgrades are scattered about, and each one can be applied in a number of different ways to affect how bullets fire: speed, power, direction, etc. these can be switched up at any time, and it\u2019s an excellent way of adding variety to a single weapon.",
        "this screen packs in an awful lot of info, but it explains very little of it!",
        "the boss fights in xeodrifter are, as already mentioned, somewhat repetitive, but they have a rewarding level of difficulty, and the upgrades you gain can \u2014 and must \u2014 be used against each iteration, as it develops its powers. this can be easy to miss \u2014 in fact, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s easy to miss here since explanation is scant. from the gun upgrades to boss behaviour, and even how some of the powers work, you\u2019ll need to figure everything out with very little help on offer. but it\u2019s all so manageable, pitched at such a reasonable level of difficulty, that nothing\u2019s really going to slow down your progress for long.",
        "there are one or two small annoyances. the jumping can be really disconcerting at times, with possibly too much momentum propelling you into enemy paths when you land. secret areas are often of the \u2018totally hidden\u2019 type, where you simply need to try pushing against walls that turn out to be secret passageways. this makes for some manual hunting around rather than calling on any clever detective skills. and the early game can be a bit frustrating since health is tricky to regain. but, overall, the positives vastly outweigh these gripes and xeodrifter is up there with",
        "gato roboto",
        "as the best example of what retro mini-metroidvanias have to offer.",
        "another layer of gameplay beckons in the background \u2014 this mechanic is possibly the highlight of the game.",
        "verdict",
        "\ud83d\ude00",
        "is such a good example of a very small but excellently formed metroidvania, that i think it should be on some game development course somewhere. a perfect game to play through in a weekend, especially for those who like the genre\u2019s classic ingredients, but aren\u2019t keen on getting lost exploring vast maps.",
        "i played",
        "on nintendo switch, for about",
        "3\u20134 hours",
        ". in that time, i went all-out to collect as many of the items as i could, and i finished with one collectible still to find. after initial reluctance, i went back to the game and found that last power-up pretty quickly. it\u2019s not a game to revisit immediately, but one that i could imagine playing through again in a couple of years.",
        "i paid just",

        "which made the game feel like amazing value for money. to be honest, i\u2019m not sure i would shell out the full \u00a38.99 normal price, having played it through, but it goes on sale every few months. the game was developed by",
