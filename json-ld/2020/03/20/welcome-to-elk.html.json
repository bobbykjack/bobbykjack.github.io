        "welcome to elk",
        "has a distinctive colouring-book style with bold line drawings, shades of grey, and colour fills to denote items of interest. it works functionally very well, looks great, and also fits the jovial nature of at least the game\u2019s introduction.",

        "do",
        "turn a bit darker \u2014 or at least quirkier \u2014 later on in the demo, and this certainly makes for an intriguing plotline. the game is very narrative-driven, if this demo is anything to go by. i\u2019m expecting the full game to feature quite a few more mini-games, but it looks like there will be plenty of twists and turns in the story to keep things interesting anyway.",
        "characters",
        "the characters are an eclectic mix, and even in this short demo, elements of their personalities shine through. their stories may only be hinted at, but i\u2019m left wanting to explore them in further detail.",
        "mini-games",
        "there\u2019s just the one which is essentially a case of mimicking keyboard cursor presses by diagram \u2014 except the diagrams can be rotated. but the fun part comes in the hilarious contortions the characters adopt, and the dialog between them. i couldn\u2019t be certain whether failure actually punishes the player \u2014 it would be a challenge for the mini-games to remain compelling enough if that weren\u2019t the case.",
        "gameplay",
        "i\u2019m not sure how linear it is, nor how much exploration is a part of the final game. if different paths are available, i\u2019d hope there is a way to navigate them on repeat playthroughs because skipping through the dialog you\u2019ve already read is a bit tiresome.",
        "overall, this is a fascinating game with an exciting depth to it. many of the elements have me wanting more and",
        "looks and sounds great. i hope the full game lives up to this promise!",
        "is being developed by the folk at",
        "triple topping",
        "and is scheduled for realease in 2020."
