        "the game itself \u2014 at least, this level \u2014 is a simple platformer with three controls: left, right, jump. some areas get unlocked and there\u2019s at least one hidden shortcut. you can immobilise some enemies, but combat is totally absent: this is a platformer all about avoiding danger.",
        "floaty",
        "in addition to the basics, lola can float when the jump button is held \u2014 this is an essential move to avoid certain obstacles. it\u2019s not a common mechanic, but it works really well here.",
