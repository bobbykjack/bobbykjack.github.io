        "this review is challenging for a couple of reasons:",
        "for a start, i\u2019m not exactly the target audience of this app, let alone is it something i would normally pick up.",
        "to compound matters, this is a free download, so anyone can just try it if they\u2019re remotely curious",
        "bearing that in mind, let\u2019s see if there\u2019s anything notable about",
        ".",
        "in touch screen mode, controls are ever-present and far superior to those offered in docked mode",
        "she\u2019s lost control",
        "the first thing you\u2019ll no doubt be wondering is how well the controls work in a coloring \u2018game\u2019.",
        "takes the very wise decision to offer both joycon and touch controls, as anyone would expect and hope for. however, it\u2019s not exactly as straightforward as all that.",
        "when docked, the app can",
        "only",
        "be controlled using joycons, so put that pro controller to one side. moreover, each joycon is for a separate \u2018player\u2019 (game-centric language really doesn\u2019t work here, does it?!) so a solo artist must control everything with a single joycon.",
        "the touch-screen experience is, of course, the superior one, and it\u2019s more-or-less up to scratch, barring a couple of issues which i\u2019ll cover shortly.",
        "an example of the nine initial colors and brushes that are available",
        "paint it, black",
        "the main action involves selecting a brush, a color, and applying the latter with the former. this is where joycon controls make things awkward: the ui elements appear when the appropriate button is pressed, but they appear relative to the cursor (paintbrush) which means they\u2019re off the screen a lot of the time. to use them properly, you\u2019ll need to manually move the cursor into the middle of the screen each time, which gets old pretty quick..",
        "bugs aside, the default set of colors and brushes is reasonable enough to work with. we\u2019ve got a rainbow-plus-brown palette, and standard tools including a paintbrush, flood-fill, and spray can. bizarrely, the option to undo a move \u2014 surely an absolute necessity \u2014 is only available in touch mode. even stranger, there\u2019s an expanded color palette of almost 80 colors \u2026 in touch mode. presumably, non-touch mode is bolted on only because it",
        "has to be",
        ", and the developer didn\u2019t choose to invest any time in it at all.",
        "one of the tools is a nice \u2018keep inside the lines\u2019 piece of magic. this is wisely included, since \u2014 along with undo \u2014 it\u2019s one of the few real advantages a digital coloring book can offer. but it\u2019s not really that different from the flood-fill tool, and most of the other brushes are either boring or not very useful.",
        "pictures of you",
        "in this free version, there are just a couple of pictures available to color: a jungle scene, and a space-based set-piece. additional drawings are available as paid dlc \u2014 this is the entire reason this app is available for free, after all.",
        "when you choose a picture to color, you actually then select one",
        "part",
        "of the larger image at a time; the example i tried was divided into six smaller pieces. this is by far the most interesting aspect of",
        ", although i\u2019m unsure whether it was really intentional or if the developer just went that way because they didn\u2019t want to implement a zoom (btw, there\u2019s no zoom).",
        "but this approach",
        "does",
        "mean coloring separate images, then seeing them joined together as a whole, and that can make for quite a humorous/interesting result. if you actually take your time and plan things, i\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible to ensure the image matches up correctly, but you can\u2019t copy+paste colors, so trial and error or strict adherence to the basic color set will help.",
        "the final",
        "unholy mess",
        "result.",
        "colour me in",
        "in conclusion, there\u2019s a reason",
        "is free, and that\u2019s to sell dlc. but the two included pictures, open-ended \u2018whiteboard\u2019 mode, and two-player tabletop mode should offer young colourists a brief diversion, so long as they\u2019re patient enough to grapple with the awkward controls."
