        "the intro graphics might be quite pretty if they weren\u2019t so blurry",
        "after a short intro setting the scene, the main gameplay mechanic in",
        "becomes apparent: we\u2019re in outer space, running and jumping around miniature planet-like objects, hopping between them. if that sounds too familiar, fear not: in",
        "this",
        "game, we\u2019re in just two dimensions, we\u2019re a robot, and we\u2019re shooting everything that moves.",
        "this level requires every last enemy to be obliterated",
        "most of the time i played",
        ", i had my thumb held on \u2018primary attack\u2019. there\u2019s no ammo limit and aiming is automatic, so this just makes most sense. there\u2019s still a lot of tactics involved in positioning and knowing when to switch planets, etc. the game keeps things fresh by adding different challenges from level to level, and there\u2019s enough variation in enemy behaviour to provide an element of strategy.",
        "the automatic aiming occasionally causes a problem, though, leading to shots going in the wrong direction, particularly on very small planets. it can also be problematic when faced with large numbers of adversaries. i guess this all adds to the challenge, but it seems obviously \u2018wrong\u2019 on occasion.",
        "high scores and speed records are great for replayability",
        "what impressed me was that there\u2019s a reasonable amount of content on offer here; i felt there was still a lot more to the game after an hour of play. although i reached level 7 out of 12, the difficulty ramped up considerably by then, and i only played on the easier of two difficulty settings. there are also a couple of multiplayer modes included.",
        "some levels include interesting platform designs leading to a planet\u2019s internals"
