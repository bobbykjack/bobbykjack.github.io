        "category on the eshop but, really, that should be in the absolute loosest sense possible. it\u2019s the kind of game that reminds me most of a cheap mobile game, although this is an original release. it's an \u2018endless\u2019 climber with just two controls: left or right.",
        "turn",
        "it\u2019s practically a turn-by-turn game, although enemies and rising lava will kill you if your timing\u2019s off or if you dawdle. each turn you simply choose whether to jump up to your left or to your right. one of these will often kill you, whether there\u2019s no platform to support you or spikes on the platform.",
        "attention",
        "the first few hundred points are very easy, then things start to get more difficult. i couldn\u2019t work out quite what made it that much more difficult, so it might\u2019ve just been the limit of my attention span. like all games of this ilk, the challenge is to get a high score, but it often turns out to be a battle of wills to just keep plugging away.",
        "struggle",
        "there\u2019s a bunch of bonus items \u2014 extra coins, \u2018health\u2019, a rocket to give you a boost \u2014 which try to keep things entertaining, but this really isn\u2019t one to enthrall the gamer. graphically and musically it\u2019s bearable. in gameplay terms, it\u2019s a bit of a struggle."
