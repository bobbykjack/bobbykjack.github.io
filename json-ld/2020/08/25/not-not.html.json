        "ah, good old \u201cnot\u201d, that diminutive negatory adverb beloved of logic nerds and wayne\u2019s world impressionists alike. the \u201cnot not\u201d in this game\u2019s title is a strong hint at what\u2019s to come, although the \u201ca brain buster\u201d heading helps make it crystal clear \u2014 as well as enabling the game to actually be found in the switch e-shop.",

        "not not",
        "is fast, highly logical, and infuriatingly addictive. the basic premise is simple: you have four directions in which to move and you need to pick an acceptable one, according to the instruction presented to you. that might be \u201cdown\u201d, in which case you just need to move down. or it might be \u201cnot down\u201d, in which case you\u2019ll need to move in any",

        "\u2026 ok, so \u2026 anything! yup, still easy \u2026",
        "first, the instructions are sometimes coloured in, sometimes in a different colour to what they\u2019re referencing. for example, you\u2019ll see \u201cblue\u201d rendered in the finest shade of red, and you\u2019ll need to stop your brain from getting distracted. the",

        "next comes combined instructions such as \u201cblue or right\u201d but they\u2019re typically much more complicated than just that. in fact, later on, some instructions are actually impossible to carry out, parodoxically requiring one movement and its opposite. the correct response in these cases is simply to do nothing, but since \u201cnothing\u201d is also an instruction, i didn\u2019t find that altogether clear. in fact, that goes for most of",
        "\u2014 it pretty much serves up a simple premise and leaves it up to the player to make sense of it all.",
        "\u2026 hang on \u2026",
        "as mentioned, there are 27 levels in classic mode, divided into 9 different themes, each with three different levels of difficulty. later levels are unlocked until you complete a number of earlier levels; some are locked until you achieve perfection on earlier levels by finishing them without using any continues. there\u2019s also an endless runner challenge mode.",
        "the small number of levels still manage to offer a good amount of challenge and variety",
        "is a classic hectic puzzler which demands fast reactions. it\u2019s balanced well enough that mistakes are easy to recognise but difficult to avoid. the additional challenges that each section incorporates combine pleasingly, and the endless challenge mode could well provide some longevity. there\u2019s even a multiplayer option which could make this an excellent party game."
