        "a reasonable game of mini golf somewhat spoiled by unorthodox progression.",
        "short",
        "pocket mini golf is neither a cryptic title, nor a particularly original game, so it\u2019s likely the game is more or less exactly what you\u2019re expecting. however, there are a couple of significant features which add something extra, and the result is a fairly decent, albeit short, game.",
        "skip",
        "the aim is to complete all 50 holes, each of which is always par 3. you can collect stars \u2014 strategically placed on each hole \u2014 as you go to earn the right to skip a hole or to continue after game over. every now and again, a bonus hole \u2014 with the exact same layout \u2014 pops up, giving you a very easy way of picking up lots of stars at once.",
        "whacking",
        "the main control involves simply positioning a virtual \u2018club\u2019 somewhere behind the ball, then whacking it \u2014 hey, that\u2019s golf in a nutshell, right? there\u2019s no real nuance such as skill driving power, or different clubs, but this is",
        "mini",
        "golf after all. there\u2019s a strange curved trajectory which appears if you\u2019re too close to the ball and i couldn\u2019t really figure out its point.",
        "multiplayer",
        "there\u2019s also a multiplayer option, which is simply two people playing essentially the same game in split-screen \u2014 no stars here, though. the game features a handful of options such as a top-down view and the ability to (somewhat) rotate the camera in the default 3d view. some of the obstacles are a bit confusing, and there\u2019s no explanation of any of this in the game itself.",
        "physics",
        "some of the physics seemed a bit off \u2014 in particular, one shot i hit which rebounded off a wall behaved in a completely contradictory way to what i\u2019d expect. my main complaint is the way the game requires you to play all 50 holes right from the beginning each time \u2014 those initial holes get mighty boring after a while. i appreciate the game\u2019s trying to make mini golf even",
        "more",
        "of an arcade-like experience, but i think the ability to just play through a set of holes and get an overall score would\u2019ve been better."
