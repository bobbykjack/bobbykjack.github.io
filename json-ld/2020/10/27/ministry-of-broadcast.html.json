        "big brother meets \u2026 big brother. in this pixellated tale of dystopian reality game show, you\u2019re tasked with completing a series of platforming puzzles \u2014 by fair means or foul.",
        "it might seem nepotistic, but any game with a character named \u2018bobby\u2019 is already off to a good start in my book.",
        "mining the orwell playbook is hardly an original concept, but it feels churlish to complain about that when the details are handled as well as they are in",
        ". many individual touches combine to create a chilling atmosphere \u2014 literally, with the constant snowfall and icy sections present \u2014 and the foreboding music backs this up to create a genuinely unsettling game.",
        "the overall task is to reunite with your family by competing in a challenge-based tv show. in practice, this involves walking around \u2014 there\u2019s quite a lot of walking, but thankfully, a run command makes it much less onerous \u2014 exploring warehouses, sewers, and various industrial buildings. your path is frequently blocked by puzzles which require rearranging objects, turning valves on, and completing timed jumps or opening doors in the right order.",
        "constant wall-breaking (the third wall, not the actual one) and self-aware references are par for the course",
        "the core action is often quite laboured, but it\u2019s interspersed with some magnificent set-pieces. they\u2019re not only drawn beautifully, they\u2019re also scripted to near-perfection with humour that repeatedly hits the mark, and individual moments of poignancy and hubris that will have you questioning your own outlook time and again. there\u2019s a depth here that i really wasn\u2019t expecting, and i was very pleasantly surprised that the game delivered so strongly on its message.",
        "each time i encounter a new pixel-based game, it seems that \u2018this one\u2019 is the best, but",
        "ministry of broadcast\u2019s",
        "graphics are highly impressive. a significant part of that is the animation \u2014 so many individual quirky character movements combining to create believable motion \u2014 but the backgrounds and even the text dialogs all work together to form a very nice looking whole. it put me in mind of classic pixel art adventure game",
        "the secret of monkey island",
        ", and to be able to play a platformer with that graphical style was a proper treat.",
        "this scene is dark. no, i mean it\u2019s",
        "dark",
        ".",
        "in gameplay terms, i couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of another recent pixelised title,",
        "the way remastered",
        ". everything from graphics to dialogue is done",
        "slightly",
        "better here, but the combination of puzzles, platforming, and time-trial action is very similar. none of the elements presented are really that challenging, but the game is quite extensive so it\u2019s not over in a hurry by any means.",
        "everything feels very linear in",
        ", so the amount of variety imbued in a few of the puzzles is impressive. the game occasionally suffers from slightly too much \u2018progress without meaningful input\u2019, although it\u2019s trying to tell a story, so that\u2019s forgivable to an extent.",
        "ministry\u2019s many scenes are full of detail and amusing dialogue",
        "one of",
        "ministry\u2019s",
        "most interesting aspects is that sense of dilemma, of choosing whether to be good or evil, and trying to determine just how much choice you have. the idea plays in perfectly with the overarching theme, and ultimately left me with many unanswered questions. whilst not entirely satisfying, the game certainly made me think (and feel!) a lot more than a typical platformer tends to.",
        "verdict",
        "\ud83d\ude06",
        "is not the finest platformer you\u2019ll ever encounter, but that feels slightly beside the point anyway. if you like a game that makes you think \u2014 both cognitively, and emotionally \u2014 that\u2019s wrapped up in a glorious retro veneer, you\u2019ll be hard pushed to do much better than this.",
        "i played",
        "on nintendo switch, for about",
        "6 hours",
        "and i only collected 5 of the 12 shoes (yes, shoes) initially available. it\u2019s not really a game that you can revisit without starting right from the beginning, which is tempting, but difficult for such a story-based experience.",
        "i paid",
        "\u00a38.09",
        "for",
        "which i think is right on the nose for what it is. the game was developed and published by",
        "ministry of broadcast studio",
        ", a small team that i really hope will go on to produce more."
