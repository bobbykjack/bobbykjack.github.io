        "the environment is scattered with flippers, allowing you to\n                    access every remote spot",
        "arriving on mokumana beach as yoku, a lovable dung-beetle, your\n                movement is constrained by the enormous pinball tied to your\n                belly: you can push it left and right, but that\u2019s about it.\n                soon, however, you\u2019ll come across the first pinball flipper\n                built into the ground, waiting to propel you forward, and things\n                start opening up. although some are initially locked, these\n                flippers perform the same function that jumping does, and they\n                vary in placement and angle, offering a far greater range of\n                movement than mere legwork can accomplish.",
        "the game soon introduces a host of metroidvania components,\n                including blocked pathways, plenty of helpful npcs, and currency\n                (fruit) to collect, in order to purchase items. pretty soon,\n                you\u2019re exploring the map, finding items to assist your quest,\n                and making progress in much the same way as any other game in\n                the genre.",
        "despite the familiar approach,",
        "feels open and expansive.\n                partly, this is due to a finely balanced map which really isn\u2019t\n                locked down",
        "that much",
        ". also, the very nature of the\n                environment lends itself to free movement: much of the time\n                you\u2019re outdoors, with plenty of surrounding space, and flippers\n                move you long distances fairly quickly.",
        "even the more complex tables are small and basic, but still\n                    great fun to play",
        "ultimately, those flippers come into their own when they\u2019re\n                attached to one of the many \u2018mini-pinball tables\u2019 dotted around\n                the landscape. most are required to navigate to make progress,\n                and most are blocking you one way or another, until a certain\n                exit is opened or a given condition fulfilled.",
        "each table typically features a combination of traditional\n                pinball features \u2014 bumpers, lanes, drop targets, pegs,\n                rollovers, stoppers \u2014 and a few original features such as\n                collectibles to open doors, and slugs to \u2026 er \u2026 break barriers\n                if you suck them up with a vacuum (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s explained\n                along the way!).",
        "the tables are abundant in their supply of fruit, and there\u2019s no\n                \u2018losing the ball\u2019 as such \u2014 if you miss it with the main\n                flippers, it tends to fall into a patch of thorns which remove\n                one solitary piece of fruit. fruit is",
        "everywhere",
        ", so\n                this is no hardship, and the more you play each table, the more\n                fruit you\u2019ll gather anyway.",
        "there\u2019s no doubt the tables are a fun distraction, and certainly\n                add an original edge to this metroidvania. as a pinball fan, i\n                appreciate that the mechanics are done well enough to make me\n                feel like i",
        "am",
        "actually playing a mini game of pinball\n                \u2014 there\u2019s no complaint there. where the tables",
        "do",
        "fall\n                down, unfortunately, is their simplicity. they are not difficult\n                in the slightest, and tend to be on the small side, with only a\n                handful of features. it feels as though the developers went\n                all-in on the metroidvania, did some excellent work polishing\n                the pinball mechanics to make everything smooth, but then failed\n                to replicate this effort in designing the tables themselves. the\n                tables are a diversion, never really a destination, which is a\n                shame.",
        "a good example is multiball. on a traditional pinball table,\n                multiball is a hectic rollercoaster ride, during which the\n                player can score huge points bonuses. it\u2019s pure fun, and i was",
        "really",
        "excited when i realised yie was presenting me\n                with its own version. however, multiball here just serves to\n                highlight how sparse the tables really are: there\u2019s no huge\n                point-scoring, because the game isn\u2019t really about that. and the\n                adrenalin rush just doesn\u2019t kick in when there\u2019s no jeopardy; in\n                fact, multiball becomes a bit of a slog because the aim is for\n                each ball to find a different \u2018resting place\u2019, something like\n                those old puzzles with tiny ball-bearings. and those are slow,\n                slow games, they\u2019re not pinball.",
        "the gorgeous visuals look good zoomed in or out",
        "it should be obvious from the screenshots, but",
        "is beautiful. the bright,\n                vivid graphics are sure to appeal to younger players, but the\n                whole look is one that anyone should be able to appreciate. some\n                of the details, particularly in scenes involving npcs, are\n                incredibly fine, and it\u2019s obvious that a lot of work has gone\n                into refining the look.",
        "as with any metroidvania, there are various themed \u2018zones\u2019\n                ranging from standard \u2018grassy outdoors\u2019 to underground caverns\n                and icy tundra. they merge into each other seamlessly, and\n                contribute to an overall map that is sprawling, but manageable.\n                although some backtracking is involved, it\u2019s not too far from\n                one end to the other, and a \u2018fast-travel\u2019 system is waiting to\n                be unlocked too.",
        "it\u2019s a big advantage to be able to see the whole map at any\n                time, and to be able to seamlessly travel across the whole\n                expanse without any significant loading screens interrupting.\n                the \u2018map\u2019 view is essentially just a zoomed-out version of the\n                main view you play in. whilst this looks very nice, it\u2019s a bit\n                of a problem in practice since a map usually",
        "benefits",
        "from removing and simplifying detail.",
        "cuteness, cuteness everywhere \u2014 yoku will melt all but the\n                    most cynical of hearts!",
        "the game is brimming with amusing little touches, such as the\n                party whistle you\u2019ll acquire early on. it serves a purpose, but\n                it\u2019s also incredibly charming \u2014 i defy anyone to resist\n                instinctively blowing that whistle as they traverse yoku\u2019s\n                world.",
        "so, fun gameplay, adorable characters, attractive graphics, and\n                an inventive mix of mechanics should result in a\n                knock-it-out-of-the-park hit, right? unfortunately,",
        "has one significant downside,\n                although just how much it matters will depend on what kind of\n                player you are.",
        "is easy. very easy. there is\n                basically no way to die. it\u2019s possible that \u2018losing the ball\u2019 in\n                a pinball table, when you have zero fruit, will end your run \u2014 i\n                never found out. i doubt few but the youngest players will ever\n                find out, it\u2019s just not that likely to happen.",
        "in the main world, there\u2019s nothing that can harm you at all \u2014\n                even the most dangerous-seeming creatures are benign, and you\u2019ll\n                survive the highest of falls. sometimes those falls get annoying\n                because of where you end up on the map, but it\u2019s just time\n                you\u2019ll lose, never progress.",
        "it\u2019s difficult to judge how much a difficulty level can affect a\n                game because every player has their own level of skill. but,\n                really,",
        "is so easy, it\n                sometimes felt like i was going through the motions, simply\n                following along with what the game wanted me to do, having less\n                impact than i might have expected. and the ease of the pinball\n                tables combines with the ease of the main adventure in a\n                less-than-satisfying way.",
