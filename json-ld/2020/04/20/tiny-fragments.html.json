        "these levels feel well designed, although i think the tile-swapping mechanic plays a big part in that. it creates enough combinations that levels are almost guaranteed to offer a challenging number of possibilities. the game might seem straightforward but there\u2019s enough nuance to keep things interesting.",
        "fast",
        "my main complaint is that the real-time nature can sometimes be a factor, yet it feels out-of-place. it can be difficult to select a tile in time, before the protagonist gets too far into danger. although the action pauses whilst you\u2019re moving a tile, it resumes as soon as you make a swap. i think an explicit pause/resume action would ensure the focus remains on the puzzles, not on fast reflexes."
