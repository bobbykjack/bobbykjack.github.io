<h1>Games in development</h1>

<p>
It occurred to me earlier today that a lot of the accounts I follow on Twitter are game developers, posting snippets of work-in-progress. Some of these are inspirational, many just leave me thinking “how on earth can they be so productive when all I’m doing here is scrolling through Twitter?”
</p>

<p>
So, I’m going to do a quick round-up of things I’m following, and looking forward to, particularly those that might be a bit ‘under the radar’ but, really, just the things that pique my interest at a given point in time.
</p>

<p>I highly recommend following these Twitter accounts to stay up-to-date:</p>

<h2>Lunistice</h2>

<img src="/images/gamedev/lunistice.jpeg" width="680" height="383" />

<blockquote>“a game about a magical fox and her journey to the moon!”</blockquote>

<p>
More than any other title here, Lunistice looks polished. It looks as if development has been ongoing for a couple of years, and the developer has clearly learnt a lot about GameMaker during that time, if progress is anything to go by. Take a look through the game’s Twitter feed and see just how far its come since the early days.
</p>

<p>
Right now, it’s looking like a lovingly crafted homage to 16-bit platforming — trawl through this twitter feed for gif after gif of gorgeous gameplay!
</p>

<h3>Release</h3>

<p>Not sure on specifics, but it’s looking close</p>

<h2>‘Basilisk’</h2>

<img src="/images/gamedev/basilisk.png" width="680" height="414" />

<p>
There’s no official name for this one, yet, but Loren Schmidt is too busy for such trivialities! This is a 2d, turn-based roguelike (I <em>think</em>) which has seemingly been created from the ground up in a matter of weeks. There’s an exciting amount of depth being built into the game itself, but the game’s graphics are what really makes it stand out so far — the pixelly sprites are incredibly well realised and animated with great care and attention.
</p>

<p>
Loren is documenting much of the development via Twitter, and often posts several tantalising screenshots / videos each day. For fellow gamedevs, it’s a valuable insight into the process she’s undertaking.
</p>

<h3>Release</h3>

<p>Maybe sometime in the future…</p>

<h2>Ministry of Broadcast</h2>

<img src="/images/gamedev/ministry-of-broadcast.jpeg" width="680" height="448" />

<blockquote><p>
“Ministry of Broadcast is a narrative-driven cinematic platformer, currently being developed in the Czech Republic by four people who share the same ideals, dreams, visions, and love for internet profanity.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Probably the closest here to release, MoB has a pixelart aesthetic straight out of the nineties: tall, thin figures with low resolution, but plenty of personality. In fact, the game looks purpose-built to showcase a particularly dry sense of Eastern European humour — you might sense echoes of Papers Please here.
</p>

<p>
Gruesome deaths, comical slapstick, and a feeling of impending danger are on show, and if the dystopian plotline can be delivered alongside a game that is genuinely as fun to play as it looks, MoB could be a considerable sleeper hit. 
</p>

<p>End 2019 (Switch, PS4, PC, Mac)</p>

<h2>PiAwk</h2>

<img src="/images/gamedev/piawk.jpeg" width="680" height="425" />

<blockquote><p>
“PiAwk is a little bird-like creature.. somewhat awkward and shy, but bold and curious who loves to dream and explore there.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>
PiAwk is the kind of game you take one look at and think “OK, I <em>love</em> what I’m seeing here, I just don’t know what the hell’s going on!” HiWarp has shared many screenshots and short video clips of the game in development, and it has an undeniably appealing visual style, overflowing with understated cuteness. In particular, the character animation is stunningly expressive — I cannot wait to control this little birb!
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the gameplay remains a bit of a mystery. PiAwk is described as an “Adventure / Puzzle / Platformer” which sounds just my cup of tea. Some of the puzzles we’ve seen snippets of appear to rely on physics, but there also seems to be an intriguing — and adorable — “chirp” action which sends musical notes out of our beak … to *some* effect …

<p>
    This one is in the very earliest of stages, hence the lack of information or even a name! However, there are a couple of early standout features that make this one definitely worth keeping an eye on: a potentially <a href="https://twitter.com/freerdan/status/1159363478303285250">huge game play arena</a>, combined with very smooth pixel animation, mean I’m following progress on Daniel Freer’s game closely.
</p>

<h3>Release</h3>

<p>Your guess is just as good as mine…</p>
