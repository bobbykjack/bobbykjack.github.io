            <h1>Games in development</h1>

            <p>
                It occurred to me earlier today that a lot of the accounts I
                follow on Twitter are game developers, posting snippets of
                work-in-progress. Some of these are inspirational, many just
                leave me thinking “how on earth can they be so productive when
                all I’m doing here is scrolling through Twitter?”
            </p>

            <p>
                So, I’m going to do a quick round-up of things I’m following,
                and looking forward to, particularly those that might be a bit
                ‘under the radar’ but, really, just the things that pique my
                interest at a given point in time.
            </p>

            <p>
                I highly recommend following these Twitter accounts to stay
                up-to-date:

            <h2>Lunistice</h2>

            <blockquote>
                “a game about a magical fox and her journey to the moon!”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                More than any other title here, Lunistice looks polished. It
                looks as if development has been ongoing for a couple of years,
                and the developer has clearly learnt a lot about GameMaker
                during that time, if progress is anything to go by. Take a look
                through the game’s Twitter feed and see just how far its come
                since the early days.
            </p>

            <p>
                Right now, it’s looking like a lovingly crafted homage to 16-bit
                platforming — trawl through this twitter feed for gif after gif
                of gorgeous gameplay!
            </p>

            <p>
                There’s no official name for this one, yet, but Loren Schmidt is
                too busy for such trivialities! This is a 2d, turn-based
                roguelike (I <em>think</em>) which has seemingly been created
                from the ground up in a matter of weeks. There’s an exciting
                amount of depth being built into the game itself, but the game’s
                graphics are what really makes it stand out so far — the pixelly
                sprites are incredibly well realised and animated with great
                care and attention.
            </p>

            <p>
                Loren is documenting much of the development via Twitter, and
                often posts several tantalising screenshots / videos each day.
                For fellow gamedevs, it’s a valuable insight into the process
                she’s undertaking.

                    “Ministry of Broadcast is a narrative-driven cinematic
                    platformer, currently being developed in the Czech Republic
                    by four people who share the same ideals, dreams, visions,

            <p>
                Probably the closest here to release, MoB has a pixelart
                aesthetic straight out of the nineties: tall, thin figures with
                low resolution, but plenty of personality. In fact, the game
                looks purpose-built to showcase a particularly dry sense of
                Eastern European humour — you might sense echoes of Papers
                Please here.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gruesome deaths, comical slapstick, and a feeling of impending
                danger are on show, and if the dystopian plotline can be
                delivered alongside a game that is genuinely as fun to play as
                it looks, MoB could be a considerable sleeper hit.

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “PiAwk is a little bird-like creature.. somewhat awkward and
                    shy, but bold and curious who loves to dream and explore
                    there.”
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                PiAwk is the kind of game you take one look at and think “OK, I
                <em>love</em> what I’m seeing here, I just don’t know what the
                hell’s going on!” HiWarp has shared many screenshots and short
                video clips of the game in development, and it has an undeniably
                appealing visual style, overflowing with understated cuteness.
                In particular, the character animation is stunningly expressive
                — I cannot wait to control this little birb!
            </p>

            <p>
                On the other hand, the gameplay remains a bit of a mystery.
                PiAwk is described as an “Adventure / Puzzle / Platformer” which
                sounds just my cup of tea. Some of the puzzles we’ve seen
                snippets of appear to rely on physics, but there also seems to
                be an intriguing — and adorable — “chirp” action which sends
                musical notes out of our beak … to *some* effect …

                information or even a name! However, there are a couple of early
                standout features that make this one definitely worth keeping an
