                    The first level is fine: pick up a block, move it to make a
                    matching line. Note that it can be solved in a few different
                    ways, too.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Hereâ€™s the rub: you have an arrangement of cubes, some of which
                might be stacked. Each turn, you pick up a block, and place it
                somewhere else. If your move doesnâ€™t cause a line of matching
                (by colour) cubes, 3 or more, then you fail. Matched cubes are
                removed. <b>Remove all cubes to win</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                For some reason â€” and Iâ€™m honestly not sure if this oneâ€™s on me
                or the game â€” I couldnâ€™t quite work these rules out for ages,
                simple as they are. It didnâ€™t seem obvious why my game was
                ending when it did (i.e. when nothing matched). I also didnâ€™t
                appreciate that <b>only straight-line matches</b> counted â€” I
                kept expecting Tetris shapes to match by virtue of the
                4-blocks-togetherness.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/games/box-align/rules.jpg" />
                <figcaption>
                    Pay close attention to these instructions! Only
                    straight-line matches count.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Once I fully understood the basic rules, the game was much more
                fun to play â€” at least, I wasnâ€™t just randomly moving boxes
                about anymore, hoping theyâ€™d match.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thereâ€™s a handful of <b>special cubes</b> including those that
                canâ€™t be moved, â€˜jokersâ€™ that match any colour, and locked cubes
                which spawn another cube when theyâ€™re matched. These definitely
                help to add variety to the game.
            </p>

            <p>
                <cite>Box Align</cite> includes 99 different puzzles, to be
                completed in order. They can easily be cycled through once
                complete, which is a nice touch, although I didnâ€™t have much of
                a desire to replay any levels.
            </p>

            <p>
                The whole <b>movement scheme is awkward</b> â€” this is the first
                game Iâ€™ve <em>really</em> wanted to play as VR, even more so
                than <cite>Breath of the Wild</cite>. Itâ€™s just so annoying
                having to press all these various buttons to navigate the 3D
                space â€” in particular, I found it impossible to remember whether
                ZL or ZR moved the cursor up or down.
            </p>

            <p>
                The puzzles themselves are of mixed quality: some seem like
                simply trial and error; others are challenging, but fair; and
                many demonstrate decent use of the special blocks.
            </p>

            <p>
                But the core mechanic just ... <b>isnâ€™t that interesting</b>.
                The same-colour matching in a row has been done many times
                before, and the only other mechanic, really, is deciding which
                blocks to pick up and move, and which to leave in place, to
                match later.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/games/box-align/level29.jpg" />
                <figcaption>
                    Later levels introduce more complexity and extra cube types:
                    these black-cornered ones cannot be moved themsleves.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Every now and again, I <em>do</em> feel like a decent level
                design has been executed, and itâ€™s quite fun to play a
                challenging level when you feel like you can work it out.
                However, all too often itâ€™s <b>guesswork</b> and the premise
                just doesnâ€™t lend itself very well to what should be a
                thoughtful, challenging puzzler.
            </p>

            <p>
                The best levels are, ironically, those that are essentially 2d â€”
                i.e. with all cubes on one vertical level. When everythingâ€™s
                visible, you have a decent chance of planning ahead and thinking
                through your tactics. Some of my least favourite levels go as
                far as totally obscuring a number of cubes (one in the center of
                a 3*3*3 cube-of-cubes layout, for example) â€” what am I supposed
                to do here, <em>remember</em> the details of each cube that I
                canâ€™t see right now? Thatâ€™s not fun.
            </p>

            <p>
                And, for a game where trial-and-error is so significant, where
                one false move can force you to have to start all over again, an
                â€˜undoâ€™ feature would be a very welcome addition. Time and again,
                I found myself making a move, then wanting to replay it to see
                exactly what Iâ€™d done so I could plan out the remaining moves â€”
                this is just not possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Apart from the core mechanic, though, there are a few things
                that <b>annoy</b> me about the game:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    You can move your â€˜cursorâ€™ in all six directions, but itâ€™s
                    not limited to the cubes available, so you can move it way
                    above the highest cube. Which is pointless.
                </li>

                <li>
                    You can be in a fail state â€” e.g. just one cube remaining â€”
                    but the game doesnâ€™t end. You have to make a final â€˜failing
                    moveâ€™, even though thereâ€™s no other option.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Thereâ€™s a notable pause between matched blocks disappearing
                    and the cursor being movable again.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The camera is â€¦ weird. You canâ€™t move it fully around and it
                    sometimes feels like itâ€™s working against you, like it has a
                    mind of its own. You canâ€™t zoom, although adding yet one
                    more control probably wouldnâ€™t be great, either! As I said
                    earlier, VR would offer a much nicer experience here!
                </li>

                <li>
                    When you pick up a cube, its colour gets â€˜tintedâ€™ as an
                    indication youâ€™re holding it. However, sometimes a cube gets
                    tinted to the <em>exact same colour</em> as others, leading
                    to confusion if you momentarily forget whatâ€™s going on.
                    Thing is, there isnâ€™t even really a need to indicate youâ€™re
                    holding the cube: you can see when you move the cursor, and
                    no harm can come of that. So not tinting it AT ALL would be
                    the better move hereâ€¦
                </li>
            </ol>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/games/box-align/highlighted.jpg" />
                <figcaption>
                    A critical flaw: the cube with green corners is actually
                    red, but becomes purple when â€˜picked upâ€™. The exact same
                    purple as those purple cubes!
                </figcaption>

            <h2>Verdict</h2>

            <p class="emoji">ðŸ˜ </p>

            <p>
                <cite>Box Align</cite> is not great, and it becomes more and
                more frustrating the longer I play. The later levels, of course,
                are supposed to be more difficult, but they seem to be
                disproportionately awkward because they increasingly highlight
                the gameâ€™s flaws.
            </p>

            <p>
                I played &amp; reviewed <cite>Box Align</cite> as part of the
                <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndieSelect"
                    >#IndieSelect</a
                >
                initiative spearheaded by
                <a href="https://twitter.com/IndieGamerChick"
                    >@IndieGamerChick</a
                >. It meant that I received a copy of the game for free; the
                game would have cost <em>Â£1.79</em> otherwise.
            </p>

            <p>
                The cheap price could possibly redeem it, but not when you take
                into account something like <cite>Baba Is You</cite>, another
                turn-based puzzle game, also full of (this time, welcome)
                frustration. <cite>Baba Is You</cite> is six times the price of
                this title, but I feel like itâ€™s way, way ahead of it, and far
                better value.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would not recommend <cite>Box Align</cite> for anyone other
                than the biggest puzzle-game fan; even then, I would suggest
                first trying out
                <a href="https://kasulogamestudio.itch.io/box-align"
                    >the downloadable demo for Windows</a
                >, if possible.
