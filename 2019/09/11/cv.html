<p>In July 2021 I took on a role of Floating Editor. This involves editing article submissions when regular editors are busy or absent. It requires good knowledge and understanding of the company’s style guide, and I provide writers with detailed feedback to improve overall quality.</p>

<p>After leaving <em>The Day</em>, I continued to work for the company in a contracting role for six months, making myself available for ad-hoc support and maintenance. This was remote work, on-demand, and I turned it around at short-notice, and always by deadline.</p>

<p>In my role as <em>Head of Technology</em> for <em>The Day</em>, an online newspaper aimed at schoolchildren, I was responsible for all technical strategy and in-house development. My remit also included administration of the company’s network of Apple Macs, and various other tasks required in the running of a small company.</p>

<p>The first key project I planned and implemented was the move from a traditional hosted web server to Amazon’s cloud-based AWS platform. This necessitated configuration of a large part of the server ‘stack’, including DNS transfer, SMTP, data storage, and process monitoring. The project successfully delivered a more cost-effective and flexible solution.</p>

<p>Other key projects I helped to deliver included the migration of CRM (to
    <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/">Salesforce</a>), and the development of a
    site aimed at the primary school sector.</p>

<p>The final major project I delivered was a migration of the sites’ CMS, from Joomla to a bespoke
    architecture. The resulting site was more reliable and efficient, and the backend interface easier to use, requiring fewer team resources.</p>

<p>As a member of the management team, I was also involved in strategic planning meetings, helping to define the overall direction of the company, with a specific focus on the core product. I regularly met with both the board of directors, and the ‘teacher’s advisory board’.</p>

<p>For four years, I was employed in the position of Web Developer in a small online team at Save the Children. This role primarily involved HTML, JavaScript, and CSS development for the main public-facing website. It also included maintenance of Save the Children’s site within the RedDot Content Management System, and back-end programming in the PHP scripting language.</p>

<p>During this time, I worked on some major project-related sites including ‘Kroo Bay’, a collection of multimedia resources presenting the charity’s work in a town in Sierra Leone, and ‘everyone.org’, a site that integrates and displays twitter, facebook, and YouTube content provided by Save the Children member organisations in international locations.</p>

<p>As part of the Communications team, I was responsible for strategic decisions regarding many projects, both small and large. I worked with internal clients across the company, consulting on feature requirements, development of ideas, and training requirements. I liaised closely with a number of external agencies to assist in the management of out-sourced projects.</p>

<p>Over seven years, I was employed in a variety of roles, with job titles ranging from Software Engineer to Web Developer. Throughout this time, I gained significant experience in web site and application development, having worked on front-end development, back-end server programming, and on many other aspects of such an environment.</p>

<p>My main focus was the development and maintenance of an online publishing platform, hosting primarily scientific, medical, and technical content (www.interscience.wiley.com). This involved programming in a variety of languages including C++, Java, and Perl. I was exposed to a number of technologies including HTTP, XML, Apache configuation and module programming, database design and programming, and CORBA.</p>

<p>I acted as the technical lead on several major projects, refining business requirements and creating functional specifications. I was also responsible for the coordination of small teams of developers, ensuring adherence to a project framework and production of functional requirements, design specifications, and project updates.</p>

<p>In my role as Web Developer, I designed and built an intranet solution (PHP and MySQL), then worked in an advisory and hands-on capacity for front-end development and delivery.</p>

<p>Before being hired by John Wiley on a permanent basis, I carried out a short term of employment involving the administration and management of web-page content. This work provided a grounding in the publishing process and an introduction to team-working in a corporate environment.</p>
