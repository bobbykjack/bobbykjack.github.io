<p>Lingth is a “simple line-length checker” — it checks for long lines in a file.
    This can be useful for enforcing line lengths as part of coding guidelines, but the command has general applications (see <a href="#examples">Examples</a>).</p>

<p>It should be straightforward to add to a git hook and enforce line length throughout a project.</p>

<p>Apart from being very limited, <a href="https://github.com/bobbykjack/lingth/blob/master/lingth">this code</a> is a pretty decent example of a small command-line app, written in php. It does all the flag-parsing, handling of multiple files, redirected input, etc. itself, but it’s still a very small codebase. This makes it good as a template for other work, or as an introduction to the language.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<pre>lingth *.php</pre>

    <p>Report any long lines (currently, longer than 80 chars) from all files ending ‘.php’.</p>

<pre>lingth -m22 /usr/share/dict/words</pre>

    <p>Get a list of words longer than 22 characters. (On my own system, there are exactly 22 words longer than 22 characters, all 23 or 24 characters long. “anthropomorphologically” is 23)</p>

<pre>echo foo | lingth -hln -m 2</pre>

    <p>Print ‘foo’, and nothing else, so long as ‘foo’ is longer than 2 characters (which it is!).</p>

<pre>echo '😊' | lingth -n -m 0</pre>

    <p>Confirm the length of a single emoji character is just 1 (line length is in the output).</p>

<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>You can read more about lingth in <a href="https://bobbyjack.medium.com/building-a-command-line-app-in-php-35441506e97c?sk=767251a14fdf06255adc603ef0465240">Building a command line app in PHP</a>, an article I wrote explaning best practices for Unix commands and how you can implement them.</p>

<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bobbykjack/lingth">project page is on GitHub</a>; I welcome all bug reports and patches, but I’m not <em>intending</em> on adding any features to this software; it’s intended to stay pretty much the same, for now.</p>
